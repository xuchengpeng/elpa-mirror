Asm-blox is a programming game where you are tasked with writing
code to complete puzzles.  Code is written on a 4x3 grid of cells
where your room to write code and memory is limited.  Complex
programs must be written by combining code cells, passing messages
between them.  The command `asm-blox' will open the puzzle listing
buffer where you can select a puzzle to work on.  For detains on
how to program the board please refer to the reference material
provided by this package.
