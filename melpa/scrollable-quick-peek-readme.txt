This package adds the command `scrollable-quick-peek-show' which
extends `quick-peek-show' to allow for scrolling within the
quick-peek overlay.

Up/Down arrows are the keys for scrolling

<up>: `scrollable-quick-peek-scroll-up'
<down>: `scrollable-quick-peek-scroll-down'

Any command other than those two will close the overlay.

Other than that, is should behave in the same way as `quick-peek-show'.

See M-x `customize-group' RET `quick-peek' for customisation.
