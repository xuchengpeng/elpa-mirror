This is a hydra that augments existing Emacs navigation/editing functionality
by adding awareness of symbols and configuration of the range of focus for
these operations. Its functionality can be partitioned into three categories:

  1. navigation
  2. multiple cursors / swooping
  3. searching in a directory/project

See the README for more details. Credit is due to the Spacemacs AHS Transient
State for inspiring this package.

Happy coding! ^_^
