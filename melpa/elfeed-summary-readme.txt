The package provides a tree-based feed summary interface for
elfeed.  The tree can include individual feeds, searches, and
groups.  It mainly serves as an easier "jumping point" for elfeed,
so searching a subset of the elfeed database is one action away.

`elfeed-summary' pops up the summary buffer.  The buffer shows
individual feeds and searches, combined into groups.  The structure
is determined by the `elfeed-summary-settings' variable.

Also take a look at the package README at
<https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/elfeed-summary> for more
information.
