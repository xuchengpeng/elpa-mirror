Send ical calendar invites using your Emacs mail client.  These
invites are similar to those produced by Google Calendar, Outlook
Calendar, etc. and are compatible with them.

varuga populates a message mode buffer with an ical MIME part
(using MML, the MIME Meta Language).  It also adds a plain text
part listing the time of the event in various configured timezones.

All dates and times you enter into varuga are in your local
timezone. varuga automatically converts these into a set of
configured timezones (specified in `varuga-clock-list`) for your
correspondents' benefit.

🙏 வருக வருக! (varuga varuga!) is a Tamil expression that is used
to warmly welcome people to an event.
