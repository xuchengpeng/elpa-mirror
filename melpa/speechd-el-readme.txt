speechd-el is an Emacs client to speech synthesizers, Braille
displays and other alternative output interfaces.  It provides full
speech and Braille output environment for Emacs.

It is aimed primarily at visually impaired users who need
non-visual communication with Emacs, but it can be used by anybody
who needs sophisticated speech or other kind of alternative output
from Emacs.  speechd-el can make Emacs a completely speech and
BRLTTY enabled application suitable for visually impaired users or,
depending on its configuration, it can only speak in certain
situations or when asked, to serve needs of any Emacs user.
