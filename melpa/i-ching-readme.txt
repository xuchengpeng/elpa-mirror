The I Ching or Book of Changes can be used as a divination method,
pattern generator or fixed point for millennia of commentary & exegesis.

This package provides methods for casting and describing hexagrams,
querying the oracle, and finding patterns in randomness.

The descriptions of hexagrams and their classification have been drawn from
public domain sources, tradition and antiquity. Further details of usage
along with reading & study material can be found in the README file.
