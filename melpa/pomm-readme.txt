Implementation of two time management methods in Emacs: Pomodoro
and Third Time.
This implementation features:
- Managing the timer with transient.el
- Persistent state between Emacs sessions.
  So one could close & reopen Emacs without interruption the timer.

Main entrypoints are: `pomm' for Pomodoro and `pomm-third-time' for
Third Time.

Also take a look at README at
<https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/pomm.el> for more information.
