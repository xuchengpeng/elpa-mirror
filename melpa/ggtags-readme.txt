A package to integrate GNU Global source code tagging system
(http://www.gnu.org/software/global) with Emacs.

Usage:

`ggtags' is similar to the standard `etags' package. These keys
`M-.', `M-,' and `C-M-.' should work as expected in `ggtags-mode'.
See the README in https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags for more
details.

All commands are available from the `Ggtags' menu in `ggtags-mode'.
