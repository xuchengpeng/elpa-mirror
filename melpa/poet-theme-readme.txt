An emacs theme that's well suited for prose: particularly org-mode and
markdown-mode; or any mode that works well with `variable-pitch` mode.

Emacs has very good support for multiple fonts in a single
file.  Poet uses this support to make it much more convenient to
write prose within Emacs, with particular attention paid to
org-mode and markdown-mode.  Code blocks, tables, etc are
formatted in monospace text with the appropriate backgrounds.

Theme Customizations
- `poet-theme-variable-headers`
   Enable / disable different text heights for different faces.
- `poet-theme-variable-pitch-multiplier`
   Relative size for the variable pitch font; modify for a better visual
   balance.

NOTE: poet-variable-headers was renamed to poet-theme-variable-headers.

Recommended customizations for using this theme

- Set up the base fonts you'd like to use in Emacs before loading Poet
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Iosevka" :height 130)
    (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Iosevka")
    (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Baskerville")
  On loading this theme captures the default and treats that for fixed-pitch
  rendering.

- Enable variable pitch mode for editing text
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (variable-pitch-mode 1))
