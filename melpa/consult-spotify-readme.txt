This package provides functions to interactively query
Spotify using consult.  Its main entry points are the
commands `consult-spotify-album', `consult-spotify-artist',
`consult-spotify-playlist' and `consult-spotify-track'.

This package is implemeted using the espotify library.
For espotify to work, you need to set valid values for
`espotify-client-id' and `espotify-client-secret'.  To get
valid values for them, one just needs to register a spotify
application at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications

All .el files have been automatically generated from the literate program
