This provides a single command `helm-helm-commands' which will present a helm buffer
containing a list of helm commands and short descriptions. You can press C-z on an item
to see a longer description of the command, and RET to execute the command.

Note: you can achieve the same thing with the `helm-M-x' command which comes with helm,
but that requires a few more keystrokes and doesn't show descriptions by default.
