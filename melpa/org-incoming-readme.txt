This is `org-incoming`, a package to ingest PDF files into your `org` or
`org-roam` files.

This package is intended to help you if you have a large number of "incoming"
PDF files, for example scanned handwritten notes, and you want to somehow
capture these PDFs in your org files.  "Capturing" here can mean anything
from completely transcribing them (or taking OCRed text in the PDF) to just
creating an org file with a title, a date and maybe some tags, which links to
the archived PDF.
