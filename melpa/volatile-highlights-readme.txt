Overview
========
This library provides minor mode `volatile-highlights-mode', which
brings visual feedback to some operations by highlighting portions
relating to the operations.

All of highlights made by this library will be removed
when any new operation is executed.


INSTALLING
==========
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using "C-h v
load-path" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs start up file:

   (require 'volatile-highlights)
   (volatile-highlights-mode t)


USING
=====
To toggle volatile highlighting, type `M-x volatile-highlights-mode <RET>'.

While this minor mode is on, a string `VHl' will be displayed on the modeline.

Currently, operations listed below will be highlighted While the minor mode
`volatile-highlights-mode' is on:

   - `undo':
     Volatile highlights will be put on the text inserted by `undo'.

   - `yank' and `yank-pop':
     Volatile highlights will be put on the text inserted by `yank'
     or `yank-pop'.

   - `kill-region', `kill-line', any other killing function:
     Volatile highlights will be put at the positions where the
     killed text used to be.

   - `delete-region':
     Same as `kill-region', but not as reliable since
     `delete-region' is an inline function.

   - `find-tag':
     Volatile highlights will be put on the tag name which was found
     by `find-tag'.

   - `occur-mode-goto-occurrence' and `occur-mode-display-occurrence':
     Volatile highlights will be put on the occurrence which is selected
     by `occur-mode-goto-occurrence' or `occur-mode-display-occurrence'.

   - Non incremental search operations:
     Volatile highlights will be put on the the text found by
     commands listed below:

       `nonincremental-search-forward'
       `nonincremental-search-backward'
       `nonincremental-re-search-forward'
       `nonincremental-re-search-backward'
       `nonincremental-repeat-search-forward'
       `nonincremental-repeat-search-backwar'

Highlighting support for each operations can be turned on/off individually
via customization. Also check out the customization group

  `M-x customize-group RET volatile-highlights RET'


ADJUSTING THE LOOKS TO SUIT YOUR TASTE
======================================
The following user options are provided to help you get the look you want:

   - `vhl/use-pulsing-visual-effect-p'
     Whether to use visual effect 'pulsing' for volatile highlighting.
     Pulsing involves a bright highlight that slowly shifts to the
     background color.

     If the value is nil, highlight with an unchanging color until
     next command occurs.

     If `vhl/use-pulsing-visual-effect-p' is non-nil, but the return value of
     the function `vhl/pulse/available-p' is nil, then this flag is ignored.

     Default value is `nil'.

   - `vhl/pulse-iterations'
     Number of iterations of a pulse animation for volatile highlights.

     Default value is `8'.

   - `vhl/pulse-start-delay'
     Delay before pulse animation begins in seconds.

     Default value is `0.15'.

   - `vhl/pulse-iteration-delay'
     Delay between iterations of the pulse animation in seconds.

     Default value is `0.02'.

   - `Vhl/highlight-zero-width-ranges'
     If `t', highlight the positions of zero-width ranges.

     For example, if a deletion is highlighted, then the position
     where the deleted text used to be would be highlighted.

     Default value is `nil'.

And you can change the color for volatile highlighting by editing the face:

   - `vhl/default-face'
     Face used for volatile highlights.

When you edit the face, make sure the background color does not overlap with
the default background color, otherwise the highlights will not be visible.
