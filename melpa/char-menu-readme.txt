This package allows the user to create a menu for fast insertion of
arbitrary symbols.

Features:

* The symbols can be organized in hierarchies.

* Most frequently used symbols require only one keystroke, while others
  are placed in dedicated sub-menus (for example, “arrows”) and can be
  inserted with two or three keystrokes.

* Paired characters like `“”` can be inserted.  Normally, the point will
  be placed between the characters, but if some text is selected, the
  paired character will wrap it without moving the point.
