arduino-cli-mode is an Emacs minor mode for using the excellent new
Arduino command line interface in an Emacs-native fashion.  The mode
covers the full range of arduino-cli features in an Emacs native
fashion.  The mode leverages the infinite power the GNU to provide
fussy-finding of libraries and much improved support for handling
multiple boards.  The commands that originally require multiple
steps (such as first searching for a library and then separately
installing it) have been folded into one.

For more information on the package and default board behavior,
