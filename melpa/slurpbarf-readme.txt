Slurpbarf is a library defining the minor mode `slurpbarf-mode' for
slurping and barfing, or ingesting and emitting, expressions in the
spirit of Paredit.

Supported major modes are Lisp Data mode and nXML mode; however,
the commands should mostly work also in C mode and others: a global
minor mode, `global-slurpbarf-mode', is provided.

A command for splicing expressions, `slurpbarf-splice', is included
but not bound to any key.
