An Emacs theme with cool autumnal colors against a deep blue background.
Inspired by other Emacs themes - Deeper Blue shipped with most modern
versions of GNU Emacs, Gruber Darker by Alexey Kutepov, and Naysayer by
Nick Aversano. The character designs of Rei Ayanami and
Rei Ayanami (Tentative Name) from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion by
Studio Khara/Gainax provided the main source of inspiration regarding the
central ideas behind the colors used in this theme.

This theme advocates the oxymoronic minimalist Emacs user. Popular third
party packages most likely do not have overwritten colors. Further, many
default Faces that Inherit other default Faces do not get overwritten.
Generally, only Faces that do not use Inherit have themed coloring though
exceptions exist.

A total of sixteen colors make up this theme. Eight of them stolen from other
Emacs themes or sampled from the Internet using color identifying software.
The other eight then derive from a subset of this first half. The website
https://www.color-hex.com provided much needed assistance in selecting these
derived colors according to the Analogous, Complementary, Triadic, Tint, and
Shade properties provided there. This theme's color declarations contain
in-line comments, attempting to explain the respective derivation process in
addition to crediting sources accordingly.
