This package contains a collection of packages and configurations
making it easy and fun to use email with Emacs using mu, mu4e, mbsync
and other improvements. The setup supports multiple email providers
such as Google, Apple, GMX and Proton. In addition to this elisp
package, there is an mbsync configuration that needs to be changed
