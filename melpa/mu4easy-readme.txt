This package contains a collection of packages and configurations
making it easy and fun to use email with Emacs using mu, mu4e, mbsync
and other improvements. The setup supports multiple email providers
such as Google, Apple, GMX, Outlook and Proton. In addition to this
elisp package, there is an mbsync configuration that needs to be
changed and copied manually.

Please check out the repository
https://github.com/danielfleischer/mu4easy as it contains
documentation and an mbsync configuration example, which will not be
installed when installing the package with MELPA.
