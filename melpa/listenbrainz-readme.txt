An interface to ListenBrainz, a project to store a record of the music that
you listen to. The listening data, can be used to provide statistics,
recommendations and general exploration.

The package can be used programmatically (e.g. from a music player) to auto
submit listening data `listenbrainz-submit-listen'. There are other entrypoints
for reading user stats such as `listenbrainz-stats-artists' or
`listenbrainz-listens'.

Some API calls require a user token, which can be found in your ListenBrainz
profile. Configure, set or `customize' the `listenbrainz-api-token' as needed.
