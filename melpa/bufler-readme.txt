Bufler is like a butler for your buffers, presenting them to you in
an organized way based on your instructions.  The instructions are
written as grouping rules in a simple language, allowing you to
customize the way buffers are grouped.  The default rules are
designed to be generally useful, so you don't have to write your
own.

It also provides a workspace mode which allows frames to focus on
buffers in certain groups.  Since the groups are created
automatically, the workspaces are created dynamically, rather than
requiring you to put buffers in workspaces manually.
