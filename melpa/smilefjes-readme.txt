Simple package for checking if a restaurant have a good rating with the
Food Authority of Norway (Mattilsynet).  The rating is given as a smiley
(smile is obviously good, straight mouth meh, sad is not so good).
Determined by hygienic stuff and more, and is not a test of tastiness.
Emojify mode is recommended, but not required.
