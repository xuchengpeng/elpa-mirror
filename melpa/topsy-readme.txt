This library shows a sticky header at the top of the window,
intended as a simple alternative to `semantic-stickyfunc-mode'.
The header shows which top-level definition or form the top line of
the window is within.

Mode-specific functions may be added to `topsy-mode-functions'.

NOTE: For Org mode buffers, please use org-sticky-header:
<https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header>.
