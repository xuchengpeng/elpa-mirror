Emacs-IDE (eide) is a package for Emacs that makes IDE features available
out of the box.

Most of these features are already available within Emacs, but the purpose
of this package is to automate their usage and integrate them into a
user-friendly interface.

It is suitable for almost all languages. The browsing features are provided
by Ctags and Cscope.
