seriestracker implements a major mode for tracking TV shows.
TV shows data (episode list, release dates, etc.)
are sourced from the free database hosted at episodate.com
The mode presents an outlined list of tracked shows,
their episodes and release dates, and enables the user
to see when new episodes for their favorite shows get released,
and track their progress in watching a series.
