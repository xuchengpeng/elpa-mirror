A monochromatic theme that emphasises shapes over colours.

The human eye is better at seeing contrast and shapes than it is at
seeing colours.  This idea is behind the theme.

Rather than have an angry fruit salad on one's screen, I suggest
you as a programmer/writer/artist and otherwise a person doing
textual work with Emacs, consider using a minimalist colour
palette.

There is colour in this theme, but it is reserved for exceptional
situations, such as your `flycheck' errors, and highlights.  The
colour used is red, which might not be suitable for people with
certain kinds of colour blindness, but in general the result is a
low contrast theme, with colours that stand out.

I strongly recommend combining this with a package similar to
`color-identifiers-mode'.

Dependencies:
This package requires that you have installed the following fonts.
- IBM Plex <https://github.com/IBM/plex> (OFL-1.1)
- Ubuntu Mono (Ligatured) <https://github.com/canonical/UbuntuMono-fonts>
- Victor Mono (Ligatured) <https://github.com/rubjo/victor-mono> (OFL-1.1)
- Linux Libertine <https://libertine-fonts.org/> (OFL-1.1 or GPLv3)
- Fira Code <https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode> (OFL-1.1)

Great care was taken to ensure that only freedom-respecting font
packages were used.

The best way to ensure that the fonts are installed on your system
is to use the system package manager on Linux, and/or to download
the fonts from the above links if a package manager is not available
