Citre is an advanced Ctags (or actually, readtags) frontend for Emacs.  It
offers:

- auto-completion (by `completion-at-point').
- xref and imenu integration.
- `citre-jump', a `completing-read' UI for jumping to definition.
- `citre-peek', a powerful code reading tool that lets you go down the
  rabbit hole without leaving current buffer.
