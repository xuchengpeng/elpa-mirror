org-change is a minor mode to annotate changes in org-mode files by
defining a "change" link type that hides old text and shows new
text.  Mark additions to the text with org-change-add (C-` a),
deletions with org-change-delete (C-` d), and replacements with
org-change-replace (C-` r).  Accept or reject changes with
org-change-accept (C-` k) and org-change-reject (C-` x).  LaTeX and
HTML export are available.  To change key bindings and other
settings, run M-x customize-group RET org-change.  More information
at the package URL.
