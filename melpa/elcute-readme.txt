Elcute is a library for marking and killing lines electrically in
the spirit of Paredit.  Lines are marked and killed rounding up to
whole expressions, without escaping any containing expression.

Supported major modes are Lisp Data mode and nXML mode.  The
library is scarcely useful in other modes; in particular, the
commands do not work in C mode.
