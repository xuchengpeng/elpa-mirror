This package allows the user to manage multiple projects in a single Emacs instance.
Each Emacs frame is associated with a collection, which constitute a set of
projects and a list of frames.
Each project consists of buffers and window configurations.
By leveraging the built-in package `desktop.el', the collections (and thus
the projects) are automatically saved and restored upon restarting Emacs.
