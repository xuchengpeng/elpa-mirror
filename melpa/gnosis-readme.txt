Gnosis, pronounced "noh-sis", is a spaced repetition system for
note taking & self testing, where notes are taken in a
Question/Answer/Explanation format & reviewed in spaced
intervals.

Gnosis can help you better understand and retain the material by
encouraging active engagement.  It also provides a clear structure for
your notes & review sessions, making it easier to study.
