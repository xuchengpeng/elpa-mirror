Gnosis is a spaced repetition system for note taking and
self-testing.  Notes are organized in a Question/Answer/Explanation
format and reviewed at spaced intervals.  Interval durations are
based on the success or failure of recalling the answer to each
question.

Gnosis uses a highly customizable algorithm.  Unlike traditional
methods, it doesn't depend on subjective user ratings to determine
the next review interval.  Instead, it evaluates the user's success
or failure in recalling an answer by typing it.
