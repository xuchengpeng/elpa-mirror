Gnosis is a spaced repetition system-like that enhances memory
retention through active recall.  It employs a Q&A format, where each
gnosis consists of a question, answer, and explanation.

Gnosis algorithm is highly adjustable, allowing users to set specific
values not just for note decks but for tags as well.  Gnosis'
adjustability allows users to fine-tune settings not only for entire
note collections but also for specific tagged topics, thereby creating
a personalized learning environment for each topic.
