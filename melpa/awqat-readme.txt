This package provides the `awqat-times-for-day' command which
displays the Islamic prayer times for the current day based on the
configured latitude and longitude.  You should set the values of
the `calendar-latitude' and `calendar-longitude' for the
calculations to work properly.  Refer to the documentation for how
to tweak the calculations of the prayer times.
