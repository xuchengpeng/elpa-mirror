; Although the Orthodox Churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Serbia,
; Ukraine, and Georgia continue to use the Julian calendar both for
; the Paschal cycle and for fixed feasts, the other Orthodox
; Churches follow the Revised Julian calendar for fixed feasts but
; use the original Julian Paschalion. So *strictly* speaking, using
; holiday-fixed is incorrect, but since the Revised Julian is
; exactly the same as the Gregorian until 2800 AD (when a difference
; in the leap year rule will make them diverge) I think that's a
; problem for someone else on another day.
;
; This is all fairly trivial, but putting it in a separate file gets
; it out of my ~/.emacs and makes it available if anyone else finds
; it useful.
