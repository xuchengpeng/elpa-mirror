This package will allow you to display a custom status at the end
of the echo area, like polybar but inside of Emacs.

To install, just run `M-x package-install RET echo-bar RET`.
To customize the text that gets displayed, set the variable
`echo-bar-function` to the name of your own custom function.
To turn the echo bar on or off, use `echo-bar-mode`.
