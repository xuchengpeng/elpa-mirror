Make Emacs your compass in a sea of software complexity.

This tool puts the power and knowledge of your repository history in your hands.
You can find what analyses are supported with `code-compass-cheatsheet'.
A good way to start is:
  - `code-compass-show-hotspots':
    show hotspots in code repository as a circle diagram.
    Circles are packages or modules.
    The redder the circle, the more it has been modified lately. The bigger the more code it contains.

If you are having trouble with dependencies, try `code-compass-doctor' to get some clarity.
