This package enables automatic visibility toggling of various Org elements depending on cursor position.
It supports automatic toggling of emphasis markers, links, subscripts and
superscripts, entities, and keywords.  By default, toggling is instantaneous
and only affects emphasis markers.  If Org mode custom variables that control
visibility of elements are configured to show hidden parts, the respective
`org-appear' settings do not have an effect.
