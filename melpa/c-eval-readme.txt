By analogy with the Lisp Interaction mode that comes with Emacs,
this package provides commands to instantly compile and run C code.

Use `c-eval-scratch' to get a buffer in which to write code. You
can also evaluate code from other buffers.

The following commands execute a C program from the current buffer:

* `c-eval-buffer'
* `c-eval-region'

The following commands evaluate C code from the minibuffer:

* `c-eval-expression'
* `c-eval-sizeof'
