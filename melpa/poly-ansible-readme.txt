Edit YAML files for Ansible containing embedded Jinja2 templating.

You will need to ensure that at least one of the following is installed:
• The tree-sitter-yaml Tree-sitter parser (Emacs 29 and higher only).
  https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-yaml
• The yaml-mode Emacs package.
  https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode

If you have installed Emacs with your operating system’s package
manager, it may have automatically installed the Tree-sitter parser
for you, in which case you should be good to go.
