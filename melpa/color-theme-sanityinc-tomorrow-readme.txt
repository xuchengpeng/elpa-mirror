These five color themes are designed for use with Emacs' built-in
theme support in Emacs 24, and provide a variety of contrast levels
with a broadly consistent colour assignment for each.

Usage:

Use the`load-theme' command, to activate one of these themes
programatically, or use `customize-themes' to select a theme
interactively.

Alternatively, use one of the provided wrapper commands to activate
a theme:
