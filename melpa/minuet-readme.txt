AI-powered code completion with dual modes:

- Specialized prompts and various enhancements for chat-based LLMs
  on code completion tasks.
- Fill-in-the-middle (FIM) completion for compatible models
  (DeepSeek, Codestral, and some Ollama models).

Minuet supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini,
Codestral, Ollama, Llama.cpp, and OpenAI-compatible providers)

You can use it with overlay-based ghost text via
`minuet-show-suggestion' or selecting the candidates via
`minuet-complete-with-minibuffer'.  You can toggle automatic
suggestion popup with `minuet-auto-suggestion-mode'.
