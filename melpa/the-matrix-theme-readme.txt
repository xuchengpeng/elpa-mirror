"Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix Theme is.
You'll have to see it for yourself." --Morpheus
I've made this almost monochrome green-on-black theme, because
it helps me focus. Syntax highlighting is implemented by different
font styles and a green base color which varies only in brightness
and luminosity, with additional clues in red and blue.
