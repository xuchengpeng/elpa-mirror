Display README files in Dired buffers when such are present in a manner
similar to public forges such as Codeberg/Github/Gitlab.  README files are
displayed by default as plain text buffers, but if you have additional
packages such as markdown-mode or org-view-mode installed, you can enable
those for prettier previews.
