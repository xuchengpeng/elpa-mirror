Occurx mode is an alternative to native `occur' command that makes
it easier to inspect large logs by adding the following features:

- Regexps are specified using the `rx' notation to make them more
  readable

- Search patterns are composed in a dedicated buffer rather than
  minibuffer for easier editing

- They can be easily saved and restored

- It can search for multiple matches that can occur in any order

- Occurences can span multiple lines

- Search patterns can be easily negated

- Different search patterns are highlighted in different colors
