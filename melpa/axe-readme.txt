AWS eXtensions for Emacs.  axe is an interface for interacting with
AWS resources.  axe aspires to provide an Emacs-based frontend as
an alternative to the AWS web console.  axe also tries to provide
more automated workflows for many tasks that are tediously typed
out through the AWS CLI utility.  It provides a library for
implementing functions that make AWS API requests and a buffer mode
to easily display paged API responses in Emacs buffers.
