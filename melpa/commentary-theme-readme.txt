This is a high-contrast theme designed to accentuate three visual 'layers':

1) Comments are set in red italics. The intent is for comments to stand out!

2) Strings are italic and furnished with a light yellow background, so it's
easier to track where they start and end.

3) Function definitions are in bold.
