This package provides `morlock-mode' which highlights additional
expressions in Emacs Lisp mode.

Symbols are highlighted if their `morlock-font-lock-keyword' symbol
property is non-nil.  This package does this for a few symbols, and
you can do it yourself for additional symbols.

The `morlock-font-lock-keywords' variable is used for more complex
expressions.
