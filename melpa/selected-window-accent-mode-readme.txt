The Selected Window Accent Mode is an Emacs package designed to
visually distinguish the currently selected window by applying a
unique accent color to its fringes, mode line, header line, and
margins.

(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)

  (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))

OR define your own colour:

(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
