Gumshoe is a global minor mode that quietly keep tabs on your Point
movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder of
where youâ€™ve been.

Gumshoe logs any movements outside their minimum follow distance.
They will also log any position you idle at for a while.
You may then use their log to backtrack to previous locations.
