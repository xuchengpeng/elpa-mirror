Obsidian.el lets you interact with more convenience with markdown files
that are contained in Obsidian Notes vault.  It adds autocompletion for
tags and links, jumping between notes, capturing new notes into inbox etc.

This allows you to use Emacs for editing your notes, leaving the Obsidian
app for syncing and doing more specialized stuff, like viewing notes graphs.
