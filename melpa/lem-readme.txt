link-aggregator. For information about Lemmy, see <https://joinlemmy.org>.

lem-api.el is the API requests layer. All functions return parsed JSON
data. This can be used to make other kinds of interfaces, such as for gnus or
notmuch.

lem-ui.el and lem-post.el contain the main parts of the interface.
