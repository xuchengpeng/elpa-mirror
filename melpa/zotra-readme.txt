This library provides functions to fetch bibliographic information
in different formats (e.g. bibtex) using website urls or search
identifiers (e.g. DOI). It also provides functions to fetch
attachments (e.g. PDF files) associated with a url.

This is done using ZOtero TRAnslators, but without using the Zotero client.


See the README.md file for details.
