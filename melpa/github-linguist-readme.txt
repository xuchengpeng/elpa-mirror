GitHub

You can update information on projects from `project-known-project-roots'
using `github-linguist-update-projects'. You can call the function
periodically using `run-with-idle-timer' or run it interactively.

Then you can use `github-linguist-lookup' to retrieve information on a
project. It would be possible to use it inside an annotation function for
completion, but it is not part of this package yet.
