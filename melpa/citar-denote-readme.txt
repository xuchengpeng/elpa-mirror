A minor-mode integrating 'citar' and 'denote' to create and manage
bibliographic notes.

Citar-Denote integrates the Citar bibliography package with the Denote
note-taking system.  Citar lets you browse and act on bibliographic data
in BibTeX, BibLaTeX or JSON format.  Denote is a versatile Emacs package
for taking and managing notes. Combining these two packages enables
linking notes in your Denote collection to your bibliography, providing
a complete solution for documenting literature reviews.
