A minor-mode integrating 'citar' and 'denote' to create and manage
bibliographic notes.

Taking notes about the articles and books you read is essential to
intellectual life.  Many note-taking systems can connect to a
bibliographic database (such as a plain text BibTeX file or external
software such as Zotero).  These databases are helpful when you need to
add citations to your writing.  Electronic bibliographies also help you
create and find notes related to your literature collection and provide
access to related materials, such as online sources and files stored on
your computer.

Citar-Denote integrates the Citar bibliography package with the Denote
note-taking system.  Citar lets you browse and act on bibliographic data
in BibTeX, BibLaTeX or JSON format.  Denote is a versatile Emacs package
for taking and managing notes. Combining these two packages enables
linking notes in your Denote collection to your bibliography, providing
a complete solution for documenting literature reviews.
