Mindre (which is the Swedish word for “less”) tries to strike a good balance
between usability and minimalism by almost being a monochrome theme but with
a splash of color.

Three colors are used to make certain language constructs stand out
enough for your eyes to notice them without being distracting.
The colors (in order of importance) are:
1. #5c3e99 (mindre-keyword)
   Preferably used for language constructs that acts as the beginning
   or end of a clause, such as if/then/else, when, where etc.
2. #16524F (mindre-type)
3. #54433a (mindre-verbatim)
