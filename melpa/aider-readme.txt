Tired of coding alone? This package + Aider (https://aider.chat/)
brings an AI pair programmer *inside* Emacs! Aider works seamlessly
with both *new* and *existing* codebases in your local Git repo,
using AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, even local ones!) to help you. It
can suggest improvements, squash bugs, or even write whole new
sections of code. Boost your coding with AI, without ever leaving
your Emacs comfort zone.

In-editor Aider experience:
- Manages Aider sessions per Git repo.
- Menu for AI-assisted coding

Alternatives to aidermacs:
- More Focus on build prompts using your code (buffer/selection).
- Reuse prompts easily, fuzzy search with helm.
- Organize project with repo specific Aider prompt file
- More Focus on code quality tool (Code Review, Agile + AI).
- Snippets for community prompts.
- Less configurations, simplified menu.
