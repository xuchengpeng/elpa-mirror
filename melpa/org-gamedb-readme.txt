 org-gamedb allows you to make queries for certain resources like games,
 characters, companies and extracts customizable properties from result like
 when it is released, who published it and what genre it is. You can ask a summary and
 also a cover art. org-gamedb nicely inserts them in an org headline. If you are on an
 org buffer, org-gamedb tries to utilize it for example using current headline as your query.
 Otherwise it creates a new buffer. In case there are multiple results,
 you will be asked to select one amongst candidates.

 If you don't know what to query, make an empty query!

 You need to take an API key from here https://www.giantbomb.com/api/ and
 set `org-gamedb-api-key' with it.
