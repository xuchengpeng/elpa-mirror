Provides functions that make it easy to work with the Kibit
Leiningen plugin for detecting and improving non-idiomatic
Clojure source code, from within GNU Emacs. See
<https://github.com/jonase/kibit> for more information about
Kibit.

This package does not require Cider, although if you are working
with Clojure in Emacs, you should almost certaily be using it.
