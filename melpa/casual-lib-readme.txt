Library routines for Casual user interfaces.

INSTALLATION
Casual Lib is intended to be implicitly installed as a dependency to the
Casual suite of packages. If you are running Emacs 29.x, you will need to
configure `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to t to support an update of the
built-in package `transient'.
