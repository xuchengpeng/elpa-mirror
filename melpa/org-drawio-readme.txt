When you are drawing with draw.io and you want to insert the svg
image exported from drawio file, the operation is nontrivial.  This
extension provide two commands to reduce the manual work:

- `org-drawio-add' convert drawio to svg, and insert it to org
- `org-drawio-open' open drawio file at the point
