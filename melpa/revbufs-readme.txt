`revbufs' reverts Emacs buffers that are visiting files that have been
modified outside Emacs' control.  This is useful for files generated by a
compiler, or log files.  `revbufs' won't revert a buffer that has been
modified (what it calls "conflicts"), and will tell you if any files
disappeared out from under your buffers ("orphans").
