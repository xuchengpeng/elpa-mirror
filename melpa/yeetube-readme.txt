This package provides the ability to scrape YouTube, with the results
displayed in a proced-like buffer.

Basic functionality includes:

- Query YouTube
- Play video url by default using mpv
- Bookmark/Save video url
- Download video using yt-dlp
- A minimal yt-dlp front-end, which is independent of the rest YouTube functionality, to download multiple urls.
