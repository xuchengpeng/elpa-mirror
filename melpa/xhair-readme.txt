  This package simultaneously applies `vline-mode' and
  `hl-line-mode', with tweaks, to present POINT in highlighted
  cross-hairs, reporting the value of POINT as a message in the
  echo area. This will remain in effect until toggled manually
  (function `xhair-mode' by default), or until the next keypress
  (function `xhair' by default), or for a set interval (function
  `xhair-flash' by default).
