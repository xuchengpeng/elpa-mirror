This is a plugin based on harpoon from vim (by ThePrimeagen).

It is a buffer quick-bookmark manager on steroids. Each "bookmark" is called a javelin
position, and you can easily assign and delete buffers to javelin positions. Javelin
positions are namespaced by project and branch if within a git repository. Otherwise,
just by project if not within git. Globally namespaced otherwise.
