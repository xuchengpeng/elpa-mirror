This package provides a command for taking screenshots of an
individual frame.  It also support setting up the frame according
to simple predetermined rules.  Simple examples can be found at
https://github.com/tarsius/emacsair.me/tree/master/assets/readme.

This package optionally uses the `import' and `convert' binaries
from the `imagemagick' package.  By default `import' isn't used
to take screenshots but if you want to add a drop shadow, then
`convert' is required.
