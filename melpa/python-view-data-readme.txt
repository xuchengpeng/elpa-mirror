View data in python

Call `python-view-data-print`, select a pandas dataframe, and then a buffer
will pop up with data listed/printed. Further verbs can be done, like filter
(query), select/unselect, mutate, group/ungroup, count, unique, describe, and
etc. It can be reset (`python-view-data-reset`) any time.
