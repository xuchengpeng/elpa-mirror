This package loads support for the Julia language server into eglot
and package.el.  This provides IDE-like features for editing
julia-mode buffers.  After installing this package, to load support
for the Julia language server, run eglot-jl-init.  After that,
running the eglot function in a julia-mode buffer should work
properly.
