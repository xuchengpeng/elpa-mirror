This file provides a major mode (`robot-log-mode') for highlighting
RobotFramework debug logs, as produced by
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robotframework/
robotframework/master/src/robot/output/debugfile.py).  This mode is
heavily inspired by `guix-build-log' from the `emacs-guix' package;
thanks to its authors!
