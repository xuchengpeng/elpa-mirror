Display-wttr package contains a minor mode that can be toggled
on/off.  It fetches weather information based on your
location or a location set in `display-wttr-locations' from
`https://wttr.in' and then displays it on the mode line.  The entry
point is`display-wttr'.

Heavily inspired by: `display-time'.
