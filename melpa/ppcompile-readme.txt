This package tries to ease the workflow that consists of coding locally,
compiling remotely, and fixing errors with `next-error' and `previous-error' locally.
It depends on built-in packages: auth-source,
project , files-x and compile.
And it also depends on external programs: rsync, ssh, and expect.
