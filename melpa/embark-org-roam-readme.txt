This package provides an embark export buffer for org roam nodes.

;; Usage

Use `embark-select' to select all org roam nodes of interest,
then use `embark-export', which will open a special org mode
buffer containing links to the selected nodes.

;; Tips

+ You can customize whether the exported buffer is read-only using
  the `embark-org-roam-readonly' variable.
