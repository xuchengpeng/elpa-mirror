Disproject implements Transient menus for dispatching project-related
commands on top of the `project.el' library.  It aims to provide a more
featureful version of the `project-switch-project' command, which it is
inspired by.  Those who are familiar with Projectile may also find
similarities to `projectile-commander'.
