The "lost commands" of the tab bar.

That is, simple and convenient commands that help with common tab bar
use-cases regarding the creation, selection and movement of tabs
without the need to use prefix arguments (for reasons of ergonomics:
in my own experience at least, frequently needing to type prefix
arguments breaks my flow enough to be distracting).
