This package extracts mermaid code blocks from markdown buffers, compiles
them using the mermaid-cli (mmdc), and displays the resulting image in
a new buffer.

It automatically attempts to match the generated diagram colors to your
current Emacs theme variables.

Requirements:
  npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
