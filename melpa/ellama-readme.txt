Ellama is a tool for interacting with large language models from Emacs.
It allows you to ask questions and receive responses from the
LLMs.  Ellama can perform various tasks such as translation, code
review, summarization, enhancing grammar/spelling or wording and
more through the Emacs interface.  Ellama natively supports streaming
output, making it effortless to use with your preferred text editor.
