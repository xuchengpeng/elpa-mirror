This package provides utilities for displaying elements of the
mode line as tabs and ribbons.  It also provides replacements
for a few built-in elements.

The biggest differences to similar packages is that this one is
much simpler and much more consistent.  When using this package,
then only the color of the mode line changes when a window
becomes in-/active.  Other packages additionally change what
elements are being displayed and also the appearance of an
individual element may change completely, which I found highly
distracting when trying out those packages, because I never knew
what visual clues to look for in order to find a certain piece
of information.

See README.org for setup instructions.
