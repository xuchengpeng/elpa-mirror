This package provides functionality for defining multiple histories for
comint inputs.  This is useful for dividing up histories for different
programs run through comint buffers.  Users can define custom histories via
the comint-histories-add-history macro.  Histories can be customized in
various ways including their length, if they should persist across sessions,
filters to prevent inputs from being added to the history, and more.
