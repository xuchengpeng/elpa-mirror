Multi target interface to `compile'.

This package exposes facilities for generating a collection of compilation
commands for the current buffer or project and interactively select one to
run. This can be plugged into various build frameworks such as Make or CMake
to automatically determine the list of available targets and let you
interactively select one to run.
