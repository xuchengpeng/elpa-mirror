This is an demonstration implementation of introducing window management to Emacs.
* Management of list of editable buffers
* Assignment of windows for pop-up buffers
* Switching window layout like the perspective in eclipse
* Plug-in extension

The current implementation has following perspectives:
* code      : main coding layout
* two       : side by side layout
* doc       : reading documentation layout
* dashboard : showing plug-ins like dashboard in Mac OSX
* array     : selecting buffers like expose in Mac OSX
