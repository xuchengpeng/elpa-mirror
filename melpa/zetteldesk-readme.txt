This package provides various filter functions to "traverse" your
org-roam database more smoothly.  I use it for doing revision in
lessons and I personally find it highly efficient for this
purpose.  Its also good to just sort out your thoughts.  In general,
org-roam lacks a good framework for filtering your nodes although
it has all the backend for doing that.
