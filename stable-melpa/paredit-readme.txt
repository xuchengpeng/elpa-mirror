Paredit keeps your parentheses balanced while editing.  Paredit Mode
binds keys like `(', `)', and `"' to insert or delete parentheses
and string quotes in balanced pairs as you're editing without
getting in your way, augments editing keys like `C-k' to handle
balanced expressions, and provides advanced commands for editing
balanced expressions like splicing and joining while judiciously
keeping the code you're working on indented.
