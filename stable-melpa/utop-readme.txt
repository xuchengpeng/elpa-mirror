This package provides interaction with an OCaml utop toplevel (REPL).

utop.el has two components - a nice OCaml REPL with auto-completion and a
minor mode (`utop-minor-mode'), which extends OCaml major modes
(e.g. `caml-mode' and `tuareg-mode') with commands to evaluate forms directly
in the REPL.

See the "Integration with Emacs" section of the README for more info.
