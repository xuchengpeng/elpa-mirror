Derived from the test/docs functions/macros in magnars/s.el library.

ETD allows the simple writing of examples as tests and generation of
markdown documents for both etd--functions and examples.

Currently this package is dogfooding in emacsfodder/kurecolor and will be
backported to magnars/s.el for further testing at a suitable time. It
will be released to MELPA shortly after that.

## Usage:

The easiest way to understand how to use `etd' is to check out
`kurecolor-examples.el' in this folder.
