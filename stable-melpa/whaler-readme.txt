This package provides `Whaler', a minimalistic and highly customizable
project manager focused on tailored experiences.

It is a minimalistic project manager aiming to provide an easy API to
work with repositories / directories / projects.

`Whaler' provides functions to easily create a pool of projects as
well as interact with these projects. For example, with `Whaler' you
can call `compile' in a project chosen from the minibuffer without
changing the current project. But not only you can call `compile', but
any function or custom function you want, interacting either in your
current working project or another project selected from the minibuffer.
