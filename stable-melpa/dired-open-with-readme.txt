An 'Open with' dialog for opening files in external applications from Dired.

This package is built upon freedesktop.org features and therefore works
only on operating systems and desktop environments that comply with the
XDG specifications. That should be true for the majority of GNU/Linux
distributions and BSD variants. I don't know what is the situation on
MS Windows, macOS, or and mobile systems.
