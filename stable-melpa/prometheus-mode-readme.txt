Support for various Prometheus files in Emacs. As of right now, we only
support the data/metrics files generated by exporters.

As the files could be named anything and we want to be sure that we match the
mode based on contents, I'm using `magic-mode-alist' rather than
`magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
