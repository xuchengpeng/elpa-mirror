Requirements
------------

 - Emacs 24.4
 - seq 2.20 (part of Emacs 25 and later)


Exporting
---------

Fountain Mode can export to PostScript or PDF using the troff format as
an intermediary. This requires only a troff program on your system,
such as [GNU roff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/).

Alternatively you can export using an external command-line program,
such as:

 - [afterwriting](https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs/blob/master/docs/clients.md) (JavaScript)
 - [Wrap](https://github.com/Wraparound/wrap) (Go)
 - [screenplain](https://github.com/vilcans/screenplain) (Python 3, requires ReportLab for PDF)
 - [Textplay](https://github.com/olivertaylor/Textplay) (Ruby, requires PrinceXML for PDF)

The option fountain-export-command-profiles provides some shell
commands to interface with these tools, but you are encouraged to edit
or completely replace these to suit your own needs. The format is simple
while still allowing for flexibility.
