This is the base framework of the Emacs binding for Tree-sitter, an
incremental parsing system. It includes a minor mode that provides a
buffer-local syntax tree that is updated on every text change. This minor
mode is the base for other libraries to build on. An example is the included
code-highlighting minor mode.
