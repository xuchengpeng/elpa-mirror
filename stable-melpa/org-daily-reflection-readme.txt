Reflect on your org(-roam) daily journal entries.  Shows a range of
split windows, each with an org(-roam) daily in them, at specified intervals.

You can use like one does with a paper three- or five-year diary,
to see what was happening on this day last year, and the year prior, etc.

But you could also look at the last six days of daily journals, or dailies
at other specified intervals (e.g. days, weeks, fortnights, months,
years, decades, centuries).
