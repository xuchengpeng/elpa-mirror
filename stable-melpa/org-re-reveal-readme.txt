This package provides Org export functionality to generate HTML
presentations with the presentation framework reveal.js.
In conjunction with other packages (see comments on emacs-reveal
below), this is an excellent approach to generate Open Educational
Resources (OER).

Quickstart:
0. Install reveal.js: https://revealjs.com/
1. Activate org-re-reveal.
   (a) Place this directory into your load path or install it from MELPA
       (https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).
   (b) Load package manually ("M-x load-library" followed by
       "org-re-reveal") or place "(require 'org-re-reveal)" into your
       ~/.emacs and restart or customize org-export-backends by adding
       the symbol re-reveal.
2. Load an Org file and export it to HTML.
   (a) Make sure that reveal.js is available in your current directory
       (e.g., as sub-directory or symbolic link).
   (b) Load "Readme.org" (coming with org-re-reveal).
   (c) Export to HTML: Press "C-c C-e v v" (write HTML file) or
       "C-c C-e v b" (write HTML file and open in browser)
See "Readme.org" for introduction, details, and features added to
org-reveal:
https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/-/blob/main/Readme.org
The Readme is also available as reveal.js presentation that is
generated with org-re-reveal in a CI/CD infrastructure on GitLab:
https://oer.gitlab.io/org-re-reveal/Readme.html

Note that emacs-reveal offers a project that embeds org-re-reveal,
reveal.js, and various reveal.js plugins:
https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal
Its howto, generated from Org source file with emacs-reveal:

As a real-life example, maybe check out the OER presentations
(HTML with audio, different PDF variants, references into
bibliography, index terms, management of metadata including
license information and attribution, Docker image for publication
as GitLab Pages with CI/CD) for a course on Operating Systems:
https://oer.gitlab.io/OS/

The package org-re-reveal grew out of a forked version of org-reveal
when upstream development stopped:
