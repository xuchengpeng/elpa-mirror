Lisp code to setup bibliography, cite, ref and label org-mode links. The
links are clickable and do things that are useful.

This uses vanilla completing-read in Emacs. You can customize by requiring
`org-ref-helm' or `org-ref-ivy' after this.

You should really read org-ref.org in this package for details.
