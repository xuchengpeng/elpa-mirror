I often find myself wanting to share a subtree from or an entire Org mode
file publicly.  It's convenient to use GitHub gists for this, since GitHub
renders Org mode syntax almost correctly.  This package makes it easy to do
that.  The heavy lifting of creating and updating gists is delegated to
@defunkt's `gist.el'.
