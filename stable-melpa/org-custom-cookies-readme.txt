Org mode supports the [/] and [%] statistics cookies by default
(https://orgmode.org/manual/Breaking-Down-Tasks.html), but does not allow you
to add additional types of cookies.  This package allows you to add your own
custom cookies and comes with implementations for cookies that calculate the
total duration of scheduled time, clocked time, and effort in a subtree.
