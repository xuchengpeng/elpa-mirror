Elpher aims to provide a practical and friendly gopher and gemini
client for GNU Emacs.  It supports:

- intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- out-of-the-box compatibility with evil-mode,
- clickable web and gopher links *in plain text*,
- caching of visited sites,
- pleasant and configurable colouring of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- gopher connections using TLS encryption,
- the fledgling Gemini protocol,
- the greybeard Finger protocol.

To launch Elpher, simply use 'M-x elpher'.  This will open a start
page containing information on key bindings and suggested starting
points for your gopher exploration.

Full instructions can be found in the Elpher info manual.

Elpher is under active development.  Any suggestions for
improvements are welcome, and can be made on the official project
page, gopher://thelambdalab.xyz/1/projects/elpher, or via the
project mailing list at https://lists.sr.ht/~michel-slm/elpher.
