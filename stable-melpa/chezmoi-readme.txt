Chezmoi is a dotfile management system that uses a source-target state
architecture.  This package provides convenience functions for maintaining
synchronization between the source and target states when making changes to
your dotfiles through Emacs.  It provides alternatives to `find-file' and
`save-buffer' for source state files which maintain synchronization to the
target state.  It also provides diff/ediff tools for resolving when dotfiles
get out of sync.  Dired and magit integration is also provided.
