`agent-shell' offers a native `comint' shell experience to
interact with any agent powered by ACP (Agent Client Protocol).

`agent-shell' currently provides access to Claude Code, Cursor,
Gemini CLI, Goose, Codex, OpenCode, and Qwen amongst other agents.

This package depends on the `acp' package to provide the ACP layer
as per https://agentclientprotocol.com spec.
