Syntree.el returns plain text constituency trees, given an input
that specifies the constituency.  It is primarily aimed at
linguists (syntacticians, semanticists etc.) who might want to have
trees in their plain text nodes because of their portability, but
it can of course be used to draw any sort of tree of the suitable
form.

For full documentation, see the readme file at
         <https://github.com/enricoflor/syntree>
or the info page installed with the package.
