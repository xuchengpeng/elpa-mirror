*N.B.:* This package has been absorbed, and is therefore made
obsolete, by the `dash' package, version 2.18.0.

If you maintain a package that depends on `dash-functional', then
you should change that to instead depend on `dash' version 2.18.0,
and remove all references to `dash-functional'.

If you use any packages that depend on `dash-functional', either
directly or indirectly, then you will have to wait until all of
them have transitioned away from it before you can remove it.
