`streak-mode' is a minor mode for tracking daily streaks. Exercising?
Learning a language? Trying to quit a bad habit? Track your success in your
mode line!

Start a new streak with `streak-new'. If you've broken a streak, it can be
reset with `streak-reset'. Don't worry, you'll do better next time!

See the Github README for configuration specifics.
