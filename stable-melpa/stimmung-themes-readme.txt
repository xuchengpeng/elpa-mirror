Stimmung (dark and light) is a pair of monochrome Emacs themes
with minimal syntax highlighting.  They are inspired by Tonsky's
Alabaster theme (https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster),
following the maxim that a theme that highlights everything
paradoxically highlights nothing.  Text backgrounds (comments,
strings and constants) and font variations (definitions) are used
as alternatives to text colors, ensuring a harmonious reading
experience.  Use `stimmung-themes-dark-highlight-color' and
`stimmung-themes-light-highlight-color' to customize the highlight.
