org-web-track provides an org-mode framework that helps users track, manage,
and leverage data such as scores, prices, or states from web pages and web
APIs.

With org-web-track users can:
- Define a tracking item as an org-mode entry with a URL and selector,
  which indicate where to access and from which location to obtain the
  desired data, respectively.
- Update tracking items at any time and check their value.
- Manage a group of tracking items using the org-mode column view
  capability.
- Take advantage of data logs, which are provided as an org-mode table, to
  create a value transitive graph, for example.
