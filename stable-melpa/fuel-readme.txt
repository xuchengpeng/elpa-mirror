FUEL provides a complete environment for your Factor coding pleasure
inside Emacs, including source code edition and interaction with a
Factor listener instance running within Emacs.

FUEL was started by Jose A Ortega as an extension to Eduardo Cavazos'
original factor.el code. Eduardo is also responsible of naming the
beast.
