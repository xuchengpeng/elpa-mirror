Save and manage articles with wallabag.

Wallabag is an open-source self-hosted web application designed to help users
save and archive articles or web pages for later reading. It allows you to
save content from the web, whether it's news articles, blog posts, or any
other readable content, and access it offline. Wallabag removes unwanted
elements like ads and pop-ups, leaving only the essential text and images,
offering a clean, distraction-free reading experience.
