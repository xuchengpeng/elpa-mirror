Elcute is a library defining the minor mode `elcute-mode' for
marking and killing lines electrically in the spirit of Paredit.
Lines are marked and killed rounding up to whole expressions,
without escaping any containing expression.

Supported major modes are Lisp Data mode and nXML mode.  The
library is scarcely useful in other modes; in particular, the
commands do not work in C mode.
