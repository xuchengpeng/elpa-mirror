TopSpace lets you display a buffer's first line in the center of a window
instead of just at the top.
This is done by automatically drawing an upper margin/padding above line 1
as you recenter and scroll it down.

See https://github.com/trevorpogue/topspace for a GIF demo & documentation.

Features:

- Easier on the eyes: Recenter or scroll down top text to a more
  comfortable eye level for reading, especially when in full-screen
  or on a large monitor.

- Easy to use: No new keybindings are required, keep using all
  your previous scrolling & recentering commands, except now you
  can also scroll down the first line.  It also integrates
  seamlessly with `centered-cursor-mode' to keep the cursor
  centered all the way to the first line.
