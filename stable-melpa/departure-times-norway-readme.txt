Show public transport departure times

The command departure-times-norway-show-departures displays the next
departures from a public transport stop. The first time the command is
invoked, it will display a search prompt in the minibuffer. The next time it
is invoked, it will remember the previous selection. To select a new stop,
invoke the command with a prefix argument (typically C-u) to display the
search prompt again.
