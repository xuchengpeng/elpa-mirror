age.el provides transparent Age file encryption and decryption in Emacs. It
is based on the Emacs EasyPG code and offers similar Emacs file handling
for Age encrypted files.

Using age.el you can, for example, maintain .org.age encrypted Org files,
provide Age encrypted authentication information out of .authinfo.age, and
open/edit/save Age encrypted files via TRAMP.
