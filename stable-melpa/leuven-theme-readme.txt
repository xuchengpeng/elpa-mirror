The "leuven" color theme is an elegant and visually appealing theme designed
to enhance the appearance of Emacs, particularly in Org mode and other
contexts.  It provides a carefully crafted color scheme optimized for a white
background, creating a pleasant and readable environment for your Emacs
sessions.

To use the "leuven" theme, simply add the following line to your Emacs
configuration file:

  (load-theme 'leuven t)

This will load and activate the theme.

Requirements:
- Emacs 24 or later.

If you are interested in creating a version of the "leuven" theme for dark
backgrounds, please feel free to contribute.  I am open to integrating dark
variants into the project to provide more customization options for users.
