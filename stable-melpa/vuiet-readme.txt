Vuiet is a music player and explorer for Emacs users. It is similar in scope
to lastfm on which it is based. All tracks are played from youtube using mpv
in the background and music info taken from last.fm. Vuiet supports the
"discovery mode", where it lets you create your own playlists based on
artist, genre or your loved songs similarities. Or, you can specify single
tracks, top tracks from a given artist, known albums, etc. There is also a
lyrics database that is optionally updated with each track you play and this
database can be searched interactively and played from.
