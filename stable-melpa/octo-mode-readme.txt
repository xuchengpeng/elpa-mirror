Major mode for editing Octo source code. A high level assembly
language for the Chip8 virtual machine.
See: https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo

The mode could most likely have benefited from deriving asm-mode
as Octo is an assembly language. However part of the reasoning
behind creating this mode was learning more about Emacs'
internals. The language is simple enough to allow the mode to be
quite compact anyways.

Much inspiration was taken from yaml-mode so there might be
similarities in the source structure and naming choices.
