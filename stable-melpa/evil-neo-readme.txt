Evil-Neo allows you to use Evil's keybindings with the German Neo keyboard
layout by remapping the hjkl keys to Neo's snrt keys.  Most keybindings are
simply swapped with their counterparts, but a few liberties where taken when
it made sense.  The keys are mapped in their own minor mode, enabling the user
to turn it on and off as needed.
Evil-Neo aims to preserve Evil's distinction between motion, normal, and
visual states, mapping keys only in the modes they were originally defined
in, where possible.  The keybindings are exhaustive, with all keybindings
defined in evil-motion-state-map, evil-normal-state-map, and
evil-visual-state-map taken into account at the time of authoring this
package.
