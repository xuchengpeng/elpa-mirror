AI-powered code completion with dual modes:

- Specialized prompts and various enhancements for chat-based LLMs on code completion tasks.
- Fill-in-the-middle (FIM) completion for compatible models (DeepSeek, Codestral, and some Ollama models).

Minuet supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini,
Codestral, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible providers)

You can use it with overlay-based popup via
`minuet-show-suggestion' or selecting the candidates via
`minuet-complete-with-minibuffer'.  You can toggle automatic
suggestion popup with `minuet-auto-suggestion-mode'.
