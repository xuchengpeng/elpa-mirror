This is a package to help you find and insert rails i18n into your code.
Instead of going to the yaml files and copy i18n by i18n, you just call 'rails-i18n-insert-with-cache',
It will fetch and save on cache all i18n used by your application, so you have a reliable and easy way to search
and insert your i18ns.
