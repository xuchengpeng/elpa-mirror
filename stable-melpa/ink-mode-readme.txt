`ink-mode' provides syntax highlighting and indentation for
the Ink scripting language, developed by Inkle Studios.

Other features are: divert autocompletion and links to headers and
labels; an `ink-play' command to playtest your story from Emacs
(bound to C-c C-c by default); an outline similar to org-mode's;
error reporting using flymake; a collection of YASnippet snippets.
