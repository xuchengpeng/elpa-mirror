 Add color to your org-mode table cells.

 The principal function is `org-table-color', which can be passed a function
 that produces a face for each table cell. See
 `org-table-color--color-by-correlation' for an example.

 Or call a built-in styling function like
 `org-table-color-correlation-matrix' if you're not concerned with
 customisation.

 See the Github README for full instructions.
