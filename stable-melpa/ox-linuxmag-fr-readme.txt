This Org exporter is based on the OpenDocument exporter and changes
only what needs to be changed so the output is compatible with
GNU/Linux Magazine (http://www.gnulinuxmag.com/).

The ./resources/styles.xml and ./resources/template.xml files are
extracted from the OpenOffice Writer template file at
https://github.com/GLMF/outils_auteurs.
