This package provides a basic helm interface to emms, the Emacs Multimedia
System.  This interface is accessible via the interactive `helm-emms' command
and provides direct access to music directories, individual music files, and
EMMS streams.  See the `helm-emms' customization group for available
customizations, or simply call `helm-emms' to get started.
