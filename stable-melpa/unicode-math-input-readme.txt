This package provides two methods to insert mathematical symbols:

- A proper input method for efficient typing.  Activate with `C-u
  C-\ unicode-math RET'.  Then TeX commands (e.g., `\alpha') are
  replaced automatically as you type with the corresponding Unicode
  character.

- An interactive command, `unicode-math-input', which reads the TeX
  name of a symbol with completion and inserts the corresponding
  Unicode character.

In either case, all symbols provided by the unicode-math LaTeX
package are available, with the same names.

The `unicode-math' input method is similar to Emacs's built-in
`TeX', but it differs in a couple of ways.  First, it has a much
larger collection of characters, including various alphabets
(Fraktur, script, etc.) and combining accents (note you have to
type, say, \pi\hat to get π̂).  Second, it does not include any
sequence not starting with a backslash, so it interferes less with
normal typing.

The input method can be customized by the variables
`unicode-math-input-escape', `unicode-math-input-min-prefix' and
`unicode-math-input-deterministic' (but they must be set before
loading the package).
