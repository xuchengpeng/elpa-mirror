Aidermacs integrates with Aider (https://aider.chat/) for AI-assisted code
modification in Emacs. Aider lets you pair program with LLMs to edit code
in your local git repository. It works with both new projects and existing
code bases, supporting Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and can connect to almost
any LLM including local models. Think of it as having a helpful coding
partner that can understand your code, suggest improvements, fix bugs, and
even write new code for you. Whether you're working on a new feature,
debugging, or just need help understanding some code, Aidermacs provides an
intuitive way to collaborate with AI while staying in your familiar Emacs
environment.
