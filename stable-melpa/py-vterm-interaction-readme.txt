Provides a major-mode for inferior Python process that runs in
vterm, and a minor-mode that extends python-mode to support
interaction with the inferior Python process.  This is primarily
useful for running fancy python shells like ipython or ptpython.
This is a straight port of julia-vterm.el by Shigeaki Nishina
(https://github.com/shg/julia-vterm.el) with some python specific
modifications to provide functionality similar to spyder.
