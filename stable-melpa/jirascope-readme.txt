Jirascope is a package integrating Jira Cloud into Emacs,
allowing you to operate on projects and issues through either
prompt-based interactive commands, or special buffers.

Core functionality is implemented in Rust. The Rust portion is
distributed via github (automatically downloaded as needed)
and loaded as a dynamic Emacs module
