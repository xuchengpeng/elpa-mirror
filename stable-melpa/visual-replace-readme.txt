This file provides the command `visual-replace', which provides a nicer
frontend for the commands `replace-string', `replace-regexp',
`query-replace' and `query-replace-regexp'.

`visual-replace` allows editing both the text to replace and its
replacement at the same time and provide a preview of what the
replacement would look like in the current buffer.

For details, see the documentation, at
https://visual-replace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or in the Info
node visual-replace, if it is installed.
