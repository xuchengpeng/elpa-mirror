This package parses an elisp file's comments, definitions,
docstrings, and other documentation into a hierarchical `org-mode'
buffer. It is intended to facilitate familiarization with a file's
contents and organization / structure. The viewer can quickly swoop
in and out and across the file structure using standard `org-mode'
commands and keybindings.
