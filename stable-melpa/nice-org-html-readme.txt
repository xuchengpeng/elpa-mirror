This provides an org-to-html publishing pipeline with Emacs theme injection.
It enables exporting org files to readable, interactive, responsive html/css.
CSS colors are derived from specified light- and dark-mode Emacs themes.
Layout is optimized for browser consumption of org files with toc and code.

Shi Tianshu's org-html-themify provided the basic model for css injection.
This package has diverged enough to warrant independent distribution.

Various stackoverflow posts greatly helped, but alas, they are lost to me.
