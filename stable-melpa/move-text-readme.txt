MoveText 2.0.0 is a re-write of the old move-text and compatible with >= Emacs 25.1

It allows you to move the current line using M-up / M-down if a
region is marked, it will move the region instead.

Using the prefix (C-u *number* or META *number*) you can predefine how
many lines move-text will travel.
