This is a convenience tool to search for time UUIDs (v1) and preview the
corresponding date stored within it. This can be useful when loading data
that uses a v1 UUID to find the latest record.

A single function is also provided to preview a single time UUID under the
cursor, this will clean itself up afterr 5 seconds.

Get the development version from git:

   git clone git://github.com:RobertPlant/time-uuid-mode.git
