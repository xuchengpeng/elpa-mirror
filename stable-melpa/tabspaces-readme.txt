This package provides several functions to facilitate a frame-based
tab workflow with one workspace per tab, integration with project.el (for
project-based workspaces) and buffer isolation per tab (i.e. a "tabspace"
workspace). The package assumes project.el and tab-bar.el are both present
(they are built-in to Emacs 27.1+).

This file is not part of GNU Emacs.
