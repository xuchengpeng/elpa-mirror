A light theme with vivid colours and cursive text.  Inspired by
schoolgirl notebooks and chee's lychee-theme.el .

Requires the following system fonts to be installed:

- Iosevka SS05
- Iosevka Aile
- Victor Mono

Notice that different fonts might not align in monospace.  If you
customise the fonts, I recommend using my package `show-font-mode'
to compare glyph pixel sizes and adjust face proportions until
their pixel width is the same.  The faces used as bases for most
others are: `default', `italic', `variable-pitch' and `bold-italic'.
