UPGRADING to Casual 2.x

If you have installed any Casual package that is version 1.x, you should
immediately run the following commands upon installation of casual.

M-x load-libary casual
M-x casual-upgrade-base-to-version-2

This command will uninstall any Casual v1.x packages that have been
superseded by this package.

If you are using Emacs â‰¤ 30.0, you will need to update the built-in package
`transient'. By default, `package.el' will not upgrade a built-in package.
Set the customizable variable `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to `t' to
override this. For more details, please refer to the "Install" section on
this project's repository web page.
