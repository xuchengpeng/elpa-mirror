Provides additional font-locking for clojure-mode.  This font-locking
used to be part of clojure-mode up to version 3.0, but it was removed
due to its unreliable nature (the implementation is quite primitive
and font-locks symbols without any regard for what they resolve to).
CIDER provides much more reliable font-locking, that's based on the runtime
state of your Clojure application.
