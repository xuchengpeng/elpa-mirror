It's well established that Real Programmers use Emacs, and equally
well known that the determined Real Programmer can write Forth in
any language.  This package is the logical conclusion.  Those who
know what is right and true are now liberated to program the One
True Editor in the One True Language.

Try writing some El Forth in the *scratch* buffer, highlighting it,
and doing M-x elforth-eval-region. For example:

"hello" " " "world" 3 nlist 'concat apply

Or if you're feeling festive:

"Party like it's " 1970 number-to-string concat "!" concat
