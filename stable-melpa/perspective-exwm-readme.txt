A couple of tricks and fixes to make using EXWM and perspective.el
a better experience.

Most importantly, this package provides `perspective-exwm-mode',
which fixes certain annoying issues between the two packages.  Take
a look at its docstring for more info.

Other useful functions are:
- `perspective-exwm-cycle-exwm-buffers-backward' and
  `perspective-exwm-cycle-exwm-buffers-backward'
- `perspective-exwm-cycle-all-buffers-backward' and
  `perspective-exwm-cycle-all-buffers-forward'
- `perspective-exwm-switch-perspective'
- `perspective-exwm-copy-to-workspace' and
  `perspective-exwm-move-to-workspace'

Finally, take a look at the package README at
<https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/perspective-exwm.el> for more
information.
