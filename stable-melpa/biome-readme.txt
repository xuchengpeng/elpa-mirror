Interface to Open Meteo <https://open-meteo.com> for Emacs.  The
API provides weather forecasts, historical weather data, climate
change projections, and more.

The API is free for non-commercial use if you make less than 10000
requests per day.

The package has two main entrypoints: `biome' and `biome-resume'.  The
former starts a new query, the latter resumes the last query.

Also check out the README at <https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/biome>.
