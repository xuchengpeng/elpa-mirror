Display a floating Emacs frame with selected buffers.
Similar to PIP on screens.  Probably most useful in EXWM.

Use `M-x pip-frame-add-buffer' to create the frame and add
additional buffers to it and remove the buffers with
`M-x pip-frame-remove-buffer' or close the whole frame with
`M-x pip-frame-delete-frame'.
