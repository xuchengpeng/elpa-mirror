org-mpv-notes allows you to control mpv and take notes from videos
playing in mpv.  You can control mpv (play, pause, seek, ...) while
in org buffer and insert heading or notes with timestamps to the
current playing position.  Later you can revist the notes and seek
to the inserted timestamp with a few keystrokes.  Also, it can
insert screenshots as org link, run ocr (if ocr program is
installed) and insert the ocr-ed text to the org buffer.
