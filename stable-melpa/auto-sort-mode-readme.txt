Sort lines between two delimiters.
example:
<!-- { auto-sort-mode.el start } -->
A
B
C
<!-- { auto-sort-mode.el end } -->
/example

Note, the delimiters don't have to be the only thing on the line,
or at the beginning, so can be probably commented out for the
purposes of the language it's embedded in.
