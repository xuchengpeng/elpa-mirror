pomo-cat.el is a simple Pomodoro timer with cat-themed break messages.
During breaks, it shows an ASCII cat or an optional cat image using
`popon` (terminal) or `posframe` (GUI), or in a dedicated frame
(independent window).  It supports configurable durations and cycles,
making it easy to adopt for your workflow.
