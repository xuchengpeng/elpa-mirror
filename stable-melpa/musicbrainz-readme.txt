An interface to the MusicBrainz "open music encyclopedia" collection
of music metadata. The main entry points are `musicbrainz-search' for
general searches and `musicbrainz-lookup' for the more specific.
There are also some narrower searches such as `musicbrainz-search-artist'

Naming follows the MusicBrainz API reasonably closely, so the official API
documentation can provide insight into how searching, browsing and lookups
are structured. MusicBrainz has it's particular taxonomy and quirks, so
some familiarity may be required to get useful results in some cases.
