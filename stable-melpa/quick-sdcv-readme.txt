The quick-sdcv package serves as a lightweight Emacs interface for the
sdcv command-line interface, which is the console version of the StarDict
dictionary application.

This package enables Emacs to function as an offline dictionary.

functionalities directly within the Emacs environment, leveraging the
capabilities of sdcv to look up words and translations from various
dictionary files formatted for StarDict.

- `quick-sdcv-search-at-point': Searches the word around the cursor and
  displays the result in a buffer.
- `quick-sdcv-search-input': Searches the input word and displays the result
  in a buffer.
