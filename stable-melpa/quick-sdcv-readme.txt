The `quick-sdcv` package serves as an Emacs interface for the `sdcv`
command-line interface, which is the console version of the StarDict
dictionary application.

This integration allows users to access and utilize dictionary
functionalities directly within the Emacs environment, leveraging the
capabilities of `sdcv` to look up words and translations from various
dictionary files formatted for StarDict.

Below are the commands you can use:
- `quick-sdcv-search-at-point': Searches the word around the cursor and
  displays the result in a buffer.
- `quick-sdcv-search-input': Searches the input word and displays the result
  in a buffer.
