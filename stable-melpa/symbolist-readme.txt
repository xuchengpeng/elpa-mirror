Shows a buffer with a table of all Emacs Lisp symbols present in
the currently running Emacs session matching the given prefix or
regexp.

Table columns F V P show whether or not each symbol has a function
binding, a variable binding, and a property list, respectively.

Press `d' to mark symbols for deletion (i.e. unbinding and
uninterning).  Press `x' to delete all marked symbols.
