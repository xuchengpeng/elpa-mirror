ROOT (https://root.cern/) is a framework for performing data
analysis.  This package means to integrate this framework within the
ecosystem of Emacs.  More specifically, root.el provides functions
to run C++ code within the ROOT REPL and execute org-mode source
code blocks, replicating the jupyter environment in `root
--notebook'.
