This package makes it easy to browse and read RFC documents.

It offers a Helm-based browser of the list of RFCs as well as
some highlighting of hyperlinks when reading the actual RFCs.
If you want to browse the list without Helm, you might prefer
[rfcview](http://github.com/zeph1e/rfcview.el).

Todo:
- Use font-lock
- Add hyperlinks from the `Table of Contents'
