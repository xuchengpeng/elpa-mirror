forecast.el generates a _weather forecast report_ and displays it
in a buffer.  It uses data from Dark Sky (http://darksky.net), and
thus one needs to acquire an api key from them in order to use this
package.  They allow 1000 requests a day in their free plan, which
should be enough for any user.

See Installation section for installation and setup instructions.
