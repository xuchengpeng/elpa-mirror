This file provides a minor mode, `org-ref-prettify-mode', that is
supposed to be used with `org-ref' package.  After enabling this mode
(with "M-x org-ref-prettify-mode" command), you will see that the
citation org-ref links in the current buffer are shown in a more
readable format, e.g.:

  [[cite:&CoxeterPG2ed pg 53]]       ->  Coxeter, 1987, p. 53
  [[citetitle:&CoxeterPG2ed ch 3]]   ->  Projective Geometry ch 3
  [[parencite:&CoxeterPG2ed 36-44]]  ->  (Coxeter, 1987, pp. 36-44)
  [[citeauthor:See &GorFG; &RotITG; &AschFGT2ed]]  ->  See Gorenstein; Rotman; Aschbacher

The citation links themselves are not changed, they are just
displayed differently.  You can disable the mode by running "M-x
org-ref-prettify-mode" again, and you see the original links.

Also, this file provides 2 more commands:
- `org-ref-prettify-edit-link-at-point',
- `org-ref-prettify-edit-link-at-mouse'.

They allow you to edit the current link in the minibuffer.  By
default, they are bound to C-RET and the right mouse click
respectively.  But you can disable these bindings with:

  (setq org-ref-prettify-bind-edit-keys nil)

To install this package manually, add the following to your Emacs init file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-ref-prettify")
  (autoload 'org-ref-prettify-mode "org-ref-prettify" nil t)
