This package provides utilities that simplify encrypting or decrypting
emails for mu4e, instead of manually switching to your terminal then
running the GnuPG with tedious and repetitive arguments.

`mu4e-crypto-encrypt-message' replaces messages with ciphertext directly.

`mu4e-crypto-decrypt-message' decrypts messages, and displays decrypted
messages in `*mu4e-decrypted*' buffer.
