This package provides generic utilities to access Spotify and
use its query APIs, as well as controlling local players via
their dbus interface.  Although they can be used in other
programs, the functions in this package were originally
intended for consult-spotify and ivy-spotify.
For espotify to work, you need to set valid values for
`espotify-client-id' and `espotify-client-secret'.  To get
valid values for them, one just needs to register a spotify
application at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications

All .el files have been automatically generated from the literate program
