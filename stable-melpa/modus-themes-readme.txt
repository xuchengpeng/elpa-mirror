The Modus themes conform with the highest standard for
color-contrast accessibility between background and foreground
values (WCAG AAA).  They are also highly customizable and can even
be used as the basis for other themes.  Please refer to the official
Info manual for further documentation (distributed with the themes,
or available at: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes>).
