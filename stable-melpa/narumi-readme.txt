narumi is a major mode that shows a dashboard.  It shows randomly
sampled image in a directory e.g. using sway, bookmarks, and recent
files.  You can change the wallpaper to the image on the dashboard.
Since it is a dashboard, you can go to the entries of bookmarks and
recent files by clicking them.
