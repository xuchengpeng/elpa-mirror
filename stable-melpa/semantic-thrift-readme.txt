With thrift, semantic-thrift support semantic level jumping of thrift.
Until now, there is no tag tool for thrift in Emacs, including global, so I
create this tiny project, through wisent, this project implement grammatical
analysis of thirft, and through semantic, it's able to support semantic level
jumping, such like jumping to definiton, even in different file by include.
