CTRLF (pronounced "control F") is an intuitive and efficient
solution for single-buffer text search in Emacs, replacing packages
such as Isearch, Swiper, and helm-swoop. Taking inspiration from
the widely-adopted and battle-tested ctrl+F interfaces in programs
such as web browsers, but following the flow and keybindings of
Isearch, CTRLF improves on existing text search solutions in
convenience, robustness, and consistency.
