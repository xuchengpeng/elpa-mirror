The main feature of this dark color theme is its usage of a green
foreground color, achieving a retro look while still being easy on
the eyes.

Note that while I've been using this as my main theme for nearly a
year now, it still is very much a work in progress, as I've only
styled and checked the packages I actually use so far.  Some main
colors might still be subject to change.
