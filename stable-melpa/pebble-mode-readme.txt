  This is an Emacs major mode for pebble with:
       syntax highlighting
       sgml/html integration
       indentation (working with sgml)

It follows pebbles syntax reference: https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/guide/basic-usage/

Implementation sponsored by my employer Disy Informationssysteme GmbH. Thank you!

pebble-mode is based on jinja2-mode by Florian Mounier
