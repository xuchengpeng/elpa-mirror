This package is primarily designed for language learning.
To use, run the command `dyncloze' with the alternatives you want to choose
from. The program will test you on each occurence (if any), and mark each
answer in green or red depending on whether you got it correct. To clear the
buffer of these marks, run `dyncloze-erase'.

The `dyncloze' command can also be used as a function for other more advanced
forms of clozes, since it can take in more complicated regexes.
