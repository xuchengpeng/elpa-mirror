This package provides functionality for drawing and locating
"hats", small colored symbols used for indexing the text in the
visible portion of the buffer in the current window.

Setup: Call ‘global-hatty-mode’ to start displaying hats.  The
position of a hat may then be queried using the function
‘hatty-locate’.
