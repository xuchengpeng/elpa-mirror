This is a typing game for Emacs.  In this game, you type words that are
picked randomly from the most frequent words in the language you are
practicing, until time is up (by default it is one minute).  Typit is
similar to the “10 fast fingers” tests, with the difference that it is
playable and fully configurable from your Emacs.
