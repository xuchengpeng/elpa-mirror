This package provides an interface for dealing with the
[Mutant](https://github.com/mbj/mutant) testing tool, enabling
one to easily launch it from a `.rb` file or even from a `dired` buffer.
The generated output is nicely formatted and provides direct links
to the errors reported by the mutations. I've tried
to mimic the `rspec-mode` overall experience as much as possible.
