This package primarily provides two public interfaces
(1) `clang-format-lite-save-hook'
(2) `clang-format-lite-only-if-config'
In conjunction, they allow the user to adjust `clang-format-lite' to their needs.
`clang-format-lite' permits formatting on-save for both remote and local files.
See the README for more details.
