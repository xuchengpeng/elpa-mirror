Motion-Selection mode introduces a truly vanilla-Emacs friendly text
editing grammar, that works with modifier keys or using modal
editing via god mode, and which preserves all the same
keybindings and mnemonics, and all the same concepts and
behavior, as regular Emacs text editing, while also giving you
the advantages of a full grammar for text editing.
