If you are using Emacs â‰¤ 30.0, you will need to update the built-in package
`transient'. By default, `package.el' will not upgrade a built-in package.
Set the customizable variable `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to `t' to
override this. For more details, please refer to the "Install" section on
this project's repository web page.
