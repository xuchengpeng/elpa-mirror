This package provides two commands using consult to query notmuch
emails and present results either as single emails
(`consult-notmuch') or full trees (`consult-notmuch-tree').

The package also defines a narrowing source for `consult-buffer',
which can be activated with

  (add-to-list 'consult-buffer-sources 'consult-notmuch-buffer-source)
