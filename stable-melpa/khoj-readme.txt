Create an AI copilot to your `org-mode', `markdown' notes,
PDFs and images. The copilot exposes 2 modes, search and chat:

Chat provides faster answers, iterative discovery and assisted
creativity. It requires your OpenAI API key to access GPT models

Search allows natural language, incremental and local search.
It relies on AI models that run locally on your machine.
