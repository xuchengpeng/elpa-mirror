This package provides yet another implementation of linking to the
Bible from Org.  In particular, it is designed around multiple
export options (including LaTeX's bibleref
(https://ctan.org/pkg/bibleref)), and can generate links to several
major Bible websites.  Additionally, it can integrate with several
in-Emacs Bible applications to open passages within Emacs.

Specific features include:
 - Smart LaTeX export using bibleref
 - Formatted link preview when no description is provided
 - Customizable link generation
 - Integration with `bible-mode', and customizable follow behavior

; Link Syntax

The following are examples of valid links:

- Genesis/1:1-3:16 (A reference to a range of verses across
  multiple chapters)
- Genesis/1:1-3:16/NRSV (A reference to a range of verses across
  multiple chapters, with a reference to a specific translation)
- Genesis/1:1 (A reference to a single verse)
- Genesis/1:1/NRSV (A reference to a single verse, with
  translation)
- Genesis/1-3 (A reference to a range of chapters)
- Genesis/1-3/NRSV (A reference to a range of chapters, with
  translation)

; Customization

 - `ol-bible-http-provider', the http provider to use to generate a
   link.  Options include:
   - `biblegateway'
   - `bible-dot-com'
   - `bible-hub'
   - `oremus'
   - A function which takes an `ol-bible-reference' structure

- `ol-bible-latex-export-type', what sort of export format should
  be used for LaTeX.  Options include:
  - `bibleref' generates a `\bibleref' command.  Make sure to
    include `\usepackage{bibleref}' somewhere in your LaTeX header.
  - `link' will create an HTTP link using `ol-bible-http-provider'.
    If no description is provided for the link, one will be
    automatically generated (see below).
  - `bibleref-in-link' combines the two above formats, generating
    the link description using `\bibleref'.
  - `text' will use the provided description or an autogenerated
    textual reference.

- `ol-bible-viewer', the method that should be used to activate
  links.  There are four possibilities:
  - `bible-mode' will use `bible-mode' to open the passage.
  - `oremus' will open an oremus link with `eww'.
  - `link' will use a link from `ol-bible-http-provider' and
    `browse-url'
  - A function which takes an `ol-bible-reference' structure.

- `ol-bible-description-format' provides the verse and range
  separators used for automatically generated references.

- `ol-bible-display-formatted-references' can be used to disable
  generation of preview overlays.

; The `ol-bible-reference' Structure

The `ol-bible-reference' structure is used to describe a reference.
It contains several fields, and has a number of patterns of
acceptable nullity.  For more information, refer to the docstring.
