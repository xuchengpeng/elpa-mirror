Brf-mode adds functionality from the legendary programmer's editor `Brief' to Emacs.

It is not an emulation of `Brief' (there are plenty of those already), but rather
provides an accurate implementation in Emacs of specific features that I miss
from `Brief'.  Principally these are:

* Line-mode cut and paste.
* Column-mode cut and paste.
* Fully reversible paging and scrolling.
* Temporary bookmarks.
* Cursor motion undo.
* Easy window management.

See README.org or Info manual for further details.
