This library enables the use of Aider.el within Org mode Babel.
It allows sending prompts to an already running Aider.el comint buffer
directly from Org mode source blocks.

This integration enables seamless documentation of AI-assisted coding
sessions within Org mode documents, making it easier to create
reproducible workflows and tutorials.
