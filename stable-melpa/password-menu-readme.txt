`password-menu' is a UI wrapper ("porcelain") for the built-in Emacs
`auth-source' secrets library. This package allows you to display auth-source
entries in the minibuffer with either completing-read or transient. The
password for the selected entry is copied to the kill ring and system
clipboard and automatically removed later.

See https://github.com/rnadler/password-menu for usage details.
