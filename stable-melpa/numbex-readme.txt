numbex.el provides a minor mode that manages numbered examples.
Its primary function is to take care for the user of the correct
sequential numbering of examples in the buffer.  It also
automatically makes sure that references to examples are up to date
with the change in the numbering.

For explanation as to how to use numbex, check the readme.org file
at <https://github.com/enricoflor/numbex>.
