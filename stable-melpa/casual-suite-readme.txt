An umbrella package to support a single installation point for all Casual
user interfaces. Included are user interfaces for the following packages:

- casual
  - Bookmarks (casual-bookmarks)
  - Calc (casual-calc)
  - Dired (casual-dired)
  - EditKit (casual-editkit)
  - I-Search (casual-isearch)
  - IBuffer (casual-ibuffer)
  - Info (casual-info)
  - RE-Builder (casual-re-builder)
  - Org Agenda (casual-agenda)
- Avy (casual-avy)
- Symbol Overlay (casual-symbol-overlay)


INSTALLATION

As this is an umbrella package, it is highly recommended that a deep reading
of the install procedure for each user interface be done beforehand as each of
them have their own recommended customizations to go alongside them.

If you are using Emacs â‰¤ 30.0, you will need to update the built-in package
`transient'. By default, `package.el' will not upgrade a built-in package.
Set the customizable variable `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to `t' to
override this. For more details, please refer to the "Install" section on
this project's repository web page.
