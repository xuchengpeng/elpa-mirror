Paper is a  little, minimal emacs theme that is  meant to be simple
and consistent.

It  was first  intended  to resemble  the look  of  paper, but  has
diverged from  that objective.   Still, though,  I keep  calling it
Paper, as I like that name.

Paper  uses a  small colour  palette  over all  the elements.   Org
headings  are  specially  treated  with a  palette  of  equidistant
colours.  The colours  and heading font sizes  are calculated using
base and factor values which can be edited.  See source.

It's most adapted for ELisp-Org users, as I'm one such user, though
it  works fine  with Markdown,  Textile, Python,  JavaScript, Html,
Diff, Magit, etc.
