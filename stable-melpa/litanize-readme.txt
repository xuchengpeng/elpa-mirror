A simple version of Ian Bogost's method of generating "Latour Litanies"
from random wikipedia titles as an exercise in ontography, metaphorism,
and carpentry

Currently uses wikipedia titles as elements. Might be extended to use
other lists in other futures.

'M-x litanize' will generate a litany in a new buffer

'M-x litanize-at-point' will generate a litany at the point
