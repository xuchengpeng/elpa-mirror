Consult implements a set of `consult-<thing>' commands, which aim to
improve the way you use Emacs.  The commands are founded on
`completing-read', which selects from a list of candidate strings.
Consult provides an enhanced buffer switcher `consult-buffer' and
search and navigation commands like `consult-imenu' and
`consult-line'.  Searching through multiple files is supported by the
asynchronous `consult-grep' command.  Many Consult commands support
previewing candidates.  If a candidate is selected in the completion
view, the buffer shows the candidate immediately.

The Consult commands are compatible with multiple completion systems
based on the Emacs `completing-read' API, including the default
completion system, Vertico, Mct and Icomplete.

See the README for an overview of the available Consult commands and
the documentation of the configuration and installation of the
package.
