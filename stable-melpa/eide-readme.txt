Emacs-IDE (eide) is a package for Emacs that provides IDE features
(Integrated Development Environment).

Although most of these features are already available in Emacs, the purpose
of this package is to integrate them into a user-friendly interface, with
dedicated windows (source files, menu and ouput), convenient keyboard
shortcuts and project management.

It is suitable for almost all languages.
The browsing features are provided by Ctags and Cscope.
