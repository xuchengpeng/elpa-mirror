ELISA (Emacs Lisp Information System Assistant) is a project
designed to help Emacs users quickly find answers to their
questions related to Emacs and Emacs Lisp.  Utilizing the powerful
Ellama package, ELISA provides accurate and relevant responses to
user queries, enhancing productivity and efficiency in the Emacs
environment.  By integrating links to the Emacs info manual after
answering a question, ELISA ensures that users have easy access to
additional information on the topic, making it an essential tool
for both beginners and advanced Emacs users.

ELISA creates index from info manuals.  When you send message to
`elisa-chat' it search to semantically similar info nodes in index,
get first `elisa-limit' nodes, add it to context and send your
message to llm.  LLM generates answer to your message based on
provided context.  You can read not only answer generated by llm,
but also info manuals by provided links.
