This library strives to be the most accurate possible with title-casing
sentences, lines, and regions of text in English prose according to a number
of styles guides' capitalization rules.  It is necessarily a best-effort; due
to the vaguaries of written English it's impossible to completely correctly
capitalize aribtrary titles.  So be sure to proofread and copy-edit your
titles before sending them off to be published, and never trust a computer.

INSTALLATION and USE:

Make sure both titlecase.el and titlecase-data.el are in your `load-path',
and `require' titlecase.  You should then be able to call the interactive
functions defined in this file.
