Heroku client for Emacs, quick and efficient like Magit (thanks for the transient)!
It allows you to manage your Heroku apps right from within Emacs: view and tail
logs, edit environment variables, restart and destroy dynos etc.

Main entry point is `heroku-list', once it's open press `?' to see available

Requires Heroku CLI to be installed.
