Hide drawers in org-mode buffers using overlays.  These overlays
replace the visual display of drawers using their "display"
property.

Test out the functionality easily:
1. Open an org buffer.  (Indirect buffers are supported by
   org-hide-drawers.)
2. Enable `org-hide-drawers-mode'.  Drawers become "hidden": their
   displayed text is changed to `org-hide-drawers-display-string'.
3. Un-hide drawers by calling `org-hide-drawers-toggle', or
   `org-hide-drawers-make-overlaysâ€™.
4. Hide drawers by calling `org-hide-drawers-toggle' again, or
   `org-hide-drawers-delete-overlays'.
