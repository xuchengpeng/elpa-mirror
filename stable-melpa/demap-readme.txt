this package adds a minimap that shows a zoomed out view of the active window's
buffer. you can toggle showing the minimap in a side window with
`demap-toggle'.

this package has a few advantages over other minimap packages.
- support for detaching minimaps and having them on a different frame then the
     active window.
- support for multiple minimap buffers, with there own buffer local definitions
     on what buffers it can show and how to show them.
- person preference, but having the minimap on the side of the frame rather
     then on the side of the active window by default.

see the README for more information on the demap package and customization
options.
