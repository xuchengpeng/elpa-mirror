This package implements a major mode for Markless
documents.  Markless is a new document markup
standard.  You can find the Markless standard at

  https://shirakumo.org/project/Markless
  https://shirakumo.org/docs/markless

This does *not* implement a full Markless parser
that is compliant with the specification.  It uses
a simplified grammar that should be adequate for
syntax highlighting.
