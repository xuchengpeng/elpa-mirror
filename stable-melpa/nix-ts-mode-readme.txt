A major mode for editing Nix expressions, powered by the built-in
tree-sitter support in Emacs 29+.

Features:
- Complete syntax highlighting for all Nix language constructs
- Semantic highlighting distinctions (variables vs properties, etc.)
- Indentation support

Requires Emacs 30.1+ for the latest font-lock faces including
font-lock-punctuation-face and other tree-sitter enhancements, however,
it will still provide good coverage on 29.1+.
