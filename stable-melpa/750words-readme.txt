This package provides functions for posting text from Emacs to the
750words.com website. It includes two libraries:

- `750words' contains functions to handle authentication and to post a file,
  the current buffer or current selected region to 750words.com.
- `ox-750words'' defines an Org exporter to convert Org text to Markdown and
  then post it to 750words.com
