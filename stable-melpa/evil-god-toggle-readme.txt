This package toggles between Evil mode and God mode, enabling users
to switch seamlessly.
Provided states:
- `god': Full persistent God mode.
- `god-once': Enter God mode for one command, then return to Evil.
- `god-off': Like evil's built-in Emacs state.  Easy to switch to and from.
Ideal for users blending Emacs and Vim-style modal editing.
