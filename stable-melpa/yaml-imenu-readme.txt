This package enhances the imenu support in `yaml-mode'.  It
generates an index containing a full list of keys that contain any
child, with key names in the dot-separated path form like
`jobs.build.docker' and `ja.activerecord.attributes.user.nickname'.
It shines great with `which-function-mode' enabled.
