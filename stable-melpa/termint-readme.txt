This package offers macros and functions for creating and managing
REPL sessions within a terminal emulator backend (term, eat, or
vterm).  It facilitates the creation of custom REPL commands
tailored to each defined REPL, with features including starting
session, sending code, and hiding REPL windows.  This is useful for
integrating terminal-based REPLs with Emacs efficiently.
