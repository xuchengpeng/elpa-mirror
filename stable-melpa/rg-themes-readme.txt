rg is a collection of light and dark themes for Emacs designed for
readability with low eye-strain contrast ratios. Every theme is
defined through the `rg-themes-define-palette' function, that
ensures a certain degree of consistency between all the themes in
this package. The themes are:

  Ellas           (light, rg-themes-ellas.el)
  Somnus          ( dark, rg-themes-somnus.el)
  Cappuccino noir ( dark, rg-themes-cappuccino-noir.el)
  Purpurina       ( dark, rg-themes-cappuccino-purpurina.el)
