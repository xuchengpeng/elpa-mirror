Window number mode allows you to select windows by numbers.

`window-number-switch' same as `other-window' (C-x o) when windows less than three.
If have three windows (or more) showing, `window-number-switch' will
highlight window number at mode-line then prompt you input window number.

I binding `window-number-switch' on 'C-x o' to instead `other-window'.
