fedi.el provides a bunch of untility functions and macros (originally
adopted from the popular mastodon.el
<https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el> package) to make it easy to
write clients and interfaces for for JSON APIs.

If provides an http request library, buffer setup macro, and functions for
prev/next/tab navigation, text formatting and icons, live updating
timestamps, bulk buffer handling, as well as a completing-read, action, then
update view set of functions, and a rich posting interface.
