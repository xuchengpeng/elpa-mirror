The purpose of this package is to provide a way to open a group of
org-links at once.  A group is defined as all org-links under a
heading/sub heading, no need to use any special layout or formatting.

The motivation is that I usually have at least a couple of sites I need
to visit for any specific task, so opening them all at once saves me time.

Links are opened via the standard org funktion ~org-open-at-point~.
