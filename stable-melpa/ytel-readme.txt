This package provide a major mode to search YouTube videos via an elfeed-like
buffer.  Information about videos displayed in this buffer can be extracted
and manipulated by user-defined functions to do various things such as:
- playing them in some video player
- download them
The limit is the sky.

ytel works by querying YouTube via the Invidious apis (learn more on that here:
