gptel is a simple Large Language Model chat client, with support for multiple models/backends.

gptel supports

- The services ChatGPT, Azure, Gemini, Anthropic AI, Anyscale, Together.ai,
  Perplexity, and Kagi (FastGPT & Summarizer)
- Local models via Ollama, Llama.cpp, Llamafiles or GPT4All

 Additionally, any LLM service (local or remote) that provides an
 OpenAI-compatible API is supported.

Features:
- Itâ€™s async and fast, streams responses.
- Interact with LLMs from anywhere in Emacs (any buffer, shell, minibuffer,
  wherever)
- LLM responses are in Markdown or Org markup.
- Supports conversations and multiple independent sessions.
- Save chats as regular Markdown/Org/Text files and resume them later.
- You can go back and edit your previous prompts or LLM responses when
  continuing a conversation.  These will be fed back to the model.

Requirements for ChatGPT, Azure, Gemini or Kagi:

- You need an appropriate API key.  Set the variable `gptel-api-key' to the
  key or to a function of no arguments that returns the key.  (It tries to
  use `auth-source' by default)

- For Azure: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-azure', which see.
- For Gemini: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-gemini', which see.
- For Anthropic (Claude): define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-anthropic',
  which see
- For Kagi: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-kagi', which see.

For local models using Ollama, Llama.cpp or GPT4All:

- The model has to be running on an accessible address (or localhost)
- Define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-ollama' or `gptel-make-gpt4all',
  which see.

Consult the package README for examples and more help with configuring
backends.

Usage:

gptel can be used in any buffer or in a dedicated chat buffer.  The
interaction model is simple: Type in a query and the response will be
inserted below.  You can continue the conversation by typing below the
response.

To use this in any buffer:

- Call `gptel-send' to send the text up to the cursor.  Select a region to
  send only the region.

- You can select previous prompts and responses to
  continue the conversation.

- Call `gptel-send' with a prefix argument to access a menu where you can set
  your backend, model and other parameters, or to redirect the
  prompt/response.

To use this in a dedicated buffer:
- M-x gptel: Start a chat session
- C-u M-x gptel: Start another session or multiple independent chat sessions

- In the chat session: Press `C-c RET' (`gptel-send') to send your prompt.
  Use a prefix argument (`C-u C-c RET') to access a menu.  In this menu you
  can set chat parameters like the system directives, active backend or
  model, or choose to redirect the input or output elsewhere (such as to the
  kill ring).

- You can save this buffer to a file.  When opening this file, turning on
  `gptel-mode' will allow resuming the conversation.

Finally, gptel offers a general purpose API for writing LLM ineractions
that suit how you work, see `gptel-request'.
