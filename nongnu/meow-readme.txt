1 Introduction
══════════════

        Less is more

  Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs.

  Meow aims to blend modal editing into Emacs with minimal interference
  with its original key-bindings, avoiding most of the hassle introduced
  by key-binding conflicts. This leads to lower necessary configuration
  and better integration. More is achieved with fewer commands to
  remember.

  Key features compared to existing solutions:

  • Minimal configuration – build your own modal editing system
  • No third-party dependencies ([try it without touching your
    configuration])
  • Doesn't occupy too many keys
    • Much easier to remember for people trying modal editing
    • More keys available for your own key-bindings
    • Most of the time, you don't even need to hold shift!
  • Lightning fast (unlike Evil)
  • Minimizes modifier usage (e.g. `SPC x f' for `C-x C-f') inspired by
    [god-mode]
  • Better workflow for [kmacro] application at multiple locations
  • Interactive selection manipulation and expansion inspired by avy
  • Selection as top-tier object, and keybindings built around selection
  • Compatible with the vanilla Emacs keymap (or any other keymap from
    any package)
  • Effortless uniform keymaps across modes
  • Key-binding conflict handling made easy
