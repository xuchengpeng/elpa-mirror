Sweep is an embedding of SWI-Prolog in Emacs.  It uses the C
interfaces of both SWI-Prolog and Emacs Lisp to let you query
Prolog directly from Elisp.  On top of this tight integration,
Sweep provides an advanced development environment for SWI-Prolog
in Emacs.

For more information, see the Sweep manual at
<https://eshelyaron.com/sweep.html>.  To read the manual inside
Emacs, do M-x sweeprolog-info-manual, or evaluate (info "(sweep)Top").
