# Logos (logos.el)

This package provides a simple approach to setting up a "focus mode"
for Emacs.  It uses the `page-delimiter` (typically the `^L`
character) or the `outline-regexp` together with some commands to move
between pages whether narrowing is in effect or not.  It also provides
some optional stylistic tweaks which come into effect when the
buffer-local `logos-focus-mode` is enabled.  The manual shows how to
extend the code to achieve the desired result.
