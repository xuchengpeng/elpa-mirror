1 Introduction
══════════════

  This package provides a global minor mode for enabling support for
  xoauth2 authentication with auth-source.  OAuth 2.0, which stands for
  “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or
  application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of
  a user.  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol Extensions (xoauth2)
  extend the OAuth 2.0 Authentication Protocol and the JSON Web Token
  (JWT) to enable server-to-server authentication.  More info please
  check out [this stackoverflow answer].

2 Setup
═══════

  To set up, please put this file in the `load-path' of Emacs, and add
  the following lines in your Emacs configuration:

  ┌────
  │ (require 'auth-source-xoauth2-plugin)
  │ (auth-source-xoauth2-plugin-mode t)
  └────

  or with use-package:

  ┌────
  │ (use-package auth-source-xoauth2-plugin
  │   :custom
  │   (auth-source-xoauth2-plugin-mode t))
  └────

  After enabling, smtpmail should be supported.  To enable this in Gnus
  nnimap, you should also set `(nnimap-authenticator xoauth2)' in the
  corresponding account settings in `gnus-secondary-select-methods' as
  the following:

  ┌────
  │ (nnimap "account_name"
  │ 	...
  │ 	(nnimap-authenticator xoauth2)
  │ 	...
  │ 	)
  └────

  To disable, just toggle the minor mode off by calling `M-x
  auth-source-xoauth2-plugin-mode' again.

  auth-source uses the `secret' field in auth-source file as password
  for authentication, including xoauth2.  To decide which authentication
  method to use (e.g. plain password vs xoauth2), it inspects the `auth'
  field from the auth-source entry, and if the value is `xoauth2', it
  will try to gather data and get the access token for use of xoauth2
  authentication; otherwise, it will fallback to the default
  authentication method.

  When xoauth2 authentication is enabled, it will try to get the
  following data from the auth-source entry: `auth-url', `token-url',
  `scope', `client-id', `client-secret', `redirect-uri', and optionally
  `state'.  An example Authinfo entry (in JSON format as
  `~/.authinfo.json.gpg') for an Gmail account may look like below (you
  need to fill in the data between `<' and `>' based on your account
  settings):

  ┌────
  │ {
  │   "machine": "<your_imap_address_or_email>",
  │   "login": "<your_email>",
  │   "port": "imaps",
  │   "auth": "xoauth2",
  │   "auth-url": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  │   "token-url": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  │   "client-id": "<the_client_id_from_your_app>",
  │   "client-secret": "<the_client_secret_from_your_app>",
  │   "redirect-uri": "https://oauth2.dance/",
  │   "scope": "https://mail.google.com"
  │ }
  └────

  These information will be used by oauth2 to retrieve the access-token.
  This package uses an advice to switch the auth-source search result
  from the `password' to the `access-token' it got, which in turn will
  be used to construct the xoauth2 authentication string, currently in
  nnimap-login and smtpmail-try-auth-method.  To really enable xoauth2
  in smtpmail, it will add \'xoauth2 to \'smtpmail-auth-supported (if it
  is not already in the list) using `add-to-list' so that xoauth2 is
  tried first.


2.1 Comparison with other xoauth2 implementations

2.1.1 [auth-source-xoauth2]
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This plugin takes inspirations from auth-source-xoauth2 to advice the
  auth-source-search backends to add xoauth2 access-token for
  authentication.  The implementation is independent and reuses many
  existing facilities in `auth-source.el', where auth-source-xoauth2
  reimplemented most of the required functions itself.

  `auth-source-xoauth2-plugin' also makes use of `oauth2.el' and its
  storage for storing temporary/ephemeral data tokens, where
  `auth-source-xoauth2' implemented its own storage.

2.2 Notes
─────────

  Currently the auth-source requires the searched entry must have
  `secret' field set in the entry, which is not necessary when using
  xoauth2.  Therefore in the advice it temporarily disables checking for
  `:secret' if set and perform the search, and check the result before
  returning.
