2 Overview
══════════

  Transform words to alternating letter casing in order to convey
  sarcasm or mockery.  For example, convert this:

  ┌────
  │ I respect the authorities
  └────


  To this:

  ┌────
  │ i ReSpEcT tHe AuThOrItIeS
  └────


  The `altcaps' package thus makes you more effective at textual
  communication.  Plus, you appear sophisticated.  tRuSt Me.

  Use any of the following commands to achieve the desired results:

  `altcaps-word'
        Convert word to alternating letter casing.  With optional `NUM'
        as a numeric prefix argument, operate on `NUM' words forward,
        defaulting to 1.  If `NUM' is negative, do so backward.  When
        `NUM' is a negative prefix without a number, it is interpreted
        -1.

  `altcaps-region'
        Convert region words between `BEG' and `END' to alternating
        case.  `BEG' and `END' are buffer positions.  When called
        interactively, these are automatically determined as the active
        region’s boundaries, else the space between `mark' and `point'.

  `altcaps-dwim'
        Convert to alternating letter casing Do-What-I-Mean style.  With
        an active region, call `altcaps-region'.  Else invoke
        `altcaps-word' with optional `NUM', per that command’s
        functionality (read its documentation).

  The user option `altcaps-force-character-casing' forces the given
  letter casing for specified characters.  Its value is an alist of
  `(STRING . CASE)' pairs.  `STRING' is a string with a single
  character, while `CASE' is the `upcase' or `downcase' symbol (code
  sample further below).

  The idea is to always render certain characters in lower or upper
  case, in consideration of their legibility in context.  For example,
  the default altcaps algorithm produces this:

  ┌────
  │ iLlIcIt IlLiBeRaL sIlLiNeSs
  └────


  Whereas if the value of this variable declares `i' to always be
  lowercase and `L' uppercase, then we get this:

  ┌────
  │ iLLiCiT iLLiBeRaL siLLiNeSs
  └────


  The code to do this:

  ┌────
  │ (setq altcaps-force-character-casing
  │       '(("i" . downcase)
  │ 	("l" . upcase)))
  └────


3 Installation
══════════════




3.1 GNU ELPA package
────────────────────

  The package is available as `altcaps'.  Simply do:

  ┌────
  │ M-x package-refresh-contents
  │ M-x package-install
  └────


  And search for it.

  GNU ELPA provides the latest stable release.  Those who prefer to
  follow the development process in order to report bugs or suggest
  changes, can use the version of the package from the GNU-devel ELPA
  archive.  Read:
  <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/>.


3.2 Manual installation
───────────────────────

  Assuming your Emacs files are found in `~/.emacs.d/', execute the
  following commands in a shell prompt:

  ┌────
  │ cd ~/.emacs.d
  │ 
  │ # Create a directory for manually-installed packages
  │ mkdir manual-packages
  │ 
  │ # Go to the new directory
  │ cd manual-packages
  │ 
  │ # Clone this repo, naming it "altcaps"
  │ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/altcaps altcaps
  └────

  Finally, in your `init.el' (or equivalent) evaluate this:

  ┌────
  │ ;; Make Elisp files in that directory available to the user.
  │ (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/altcaps")
  └────

  Everything is in place to set up the package.


4 Sample configuration
══════════════════════

  ┌────
  │ (require 'altcaps)
  │ 
  │ ;; Force letter casing for certain characters (for legibility).
  │ (setq altcaps-force-character-casing
  │       '(("i" . downcase)
  │ 	("l" . upcase)))
  │ 
  │ ;; We do not bind any keys, but you are free to do so:
  │ (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x C-a") #'altcaps-dwim)
  │ 
  │ ;; The commands we provide:
  │ ;;
  │ ;; - `altcaps-word'
  │ ;; - `altcaps-region'
  │ ;; - `altcaps-dwim'
  └────

        Cédric Barreteau.

  Cédric is the author of an `altcaps'-inspired package for NeoVim, from
  whence I got the idea of forcing a given letter case for certain
  characters (I do it with the `altcaps-force-character-casing' user
  option): <https://github.com/cbarrete/nvim-altcaps>.
