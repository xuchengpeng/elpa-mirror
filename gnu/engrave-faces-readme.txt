There are some great packages for Exporting buffers to particular
formats, but each one seems to reinvent the core mechanism of processing
the font-lock in a buffer such that it can be exported to a particular
format.

This package aims to produce a versatile generic core which can process
a fontified buffer and elegantly pass the data to any number of backends
which can deal with specific output formats.

This is very much a work in progress, a rough plan can be seen below.  I
fully expect some important items to have been forgotten.

*Font lock processing*
• ☑ Single faces
• ☑ Merge multiple faces
• ☐ Process overlays

*Included backends*
• ☑ LaTeX
• ☑ HTML
• ☑ ANSI
