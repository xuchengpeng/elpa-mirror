> [!NOTE]
> IDLWAVE is currently maintained in limited fashion on ELPA.  In its current form it supports IDL v9.0, and is still in daily use by some users.
If you are interested in contributing to IDLWAVE's maintenance, please send a note to emacs-devel.  See the DEVELOP file for information on the file structure layout.

IDLWAVE is an add-on mode built into GNU Emacs which enables feature-rich
development and interaction with IDL, the Interactive Data Language.
It provides a compelling, full-featured alternative to the IDLDE
development environment bundled with IDL.

In addition to the Emacs package and its documentation, this
repository also includes:

- `idlwave_catalog`:     A Perl program to produce your own library catalog  ".idlwave_catalog" files.

- `tutorial.pro`: Intentionally buggy practice source code for the tutorial.  See the `Getting Started` section in the manual.
		    
- `CHANGES`: The package history
