Rec Mode is a mode for browsing and editing recfiles, which are text files
containing data structured in fields and records.  It is part of the GNU
recutils suite, for more information visit http://www.gnu.org/software/recutils.

Recfiles are text-based databases which are easy to read and write manually
using a text editor.  At the same time they feature enough structure so they can
be read, edited and processed automatically by programs.

Rec Mode offers convenience commands for navigation, edition, record statistics,
syntax highlighting, and more.  Rec Mode comes with a manual, see Info node
`(rec-mode)Introduction'.
