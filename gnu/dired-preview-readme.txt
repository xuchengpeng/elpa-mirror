# dired-preview for Emacs

This is a simple package to automatically preview in a side window the
file at point in Dired buffers. Preview windows are closed when they
are no longer relevant, while preview buffers are killed if they have
not been used for other purposes beside previewing. The package
provides several customisation options to control its behaviour.
