# dired-preview for Emacs

This is a simple and robust package to automatically preview in a side
window the file at point in Dired buffers.  Preview windows are closed
when they are no longer relevant, while preview buffers are killed if
they have not been used for other purposes beside previewing.  The
package provides several customisation options to control its
behaviour.
