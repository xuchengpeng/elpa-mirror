hiddenquote is a kind of word puzzle where you have to read
word definitions (the clues), and put the answers into a grid, using
the provided syllables.  When the grid is complete, you should be able
to read a quote in the highlighted cells.

This word puzzle is known in Argentina as Claringrilla, because they are
published by a national newspaper named "Clar√≠n".
