# sxhkdrc-mode for GNU Emacs

This is a major mode for editing `sxhkdrc` files. SXHKD is the Simple
X Hot Key Daemon which is commonly used in minimalist desktop sessions
on Xorg (I use it with bspwm, herbstluftwm, and i3wm). The `sxhkdrc`
file configures key chords, binding them to commands. For the
technicalities, read the man page `sxhkd(1)`.
