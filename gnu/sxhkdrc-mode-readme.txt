# sxhkdrc-mode for GNU Emacs

This is a major mode for editing `sxhkdrc` files.  SXHKD is the Simple
X Hot Key Daemon which is commonly used in minimalist desktop sessions
on Xorg, such as with the Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager
(BSPWM).  The `sxhkdrc` file configures key chords, binding them to
commands.  For the technicalities, read the man page `sxhkd(1)`.
