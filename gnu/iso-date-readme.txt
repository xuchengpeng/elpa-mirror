This simple library provides utilities for working with ISO date
strings (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD).  This includes:

- Returning an ISO date in a relative way (e.g. two days from now)

- Converting to Emacs internal format

- Converting to `calendar.el' internal format

- User commands for manipulating dates or integrating them with
  external packages

- Integrating ISO dates with `thingatpt.el'

- Integrating ISO dates with embark (see `embark-iso-date.el')
