rt-liberation is a GNU/Emacs package for working with the Request
Tracker (henceforth abbreviated as just ``RT'') software from Best
Practical Solutions. RT has an interactive Web interface, a command
line interface (the ``RT CLI''), and a REST interface. rt-liberation
uses the RT REST interface to communicate with the RT server.

rt-liberation allows sending search queries to the RT server, browsing
the resulting tickets, viewing the tickets' contents and performing
operations on the tickets.

rt-liberation comes with a fine manual in the doc/ directory.
