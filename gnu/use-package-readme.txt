The `use-package' declaration macro allows you to isolate package
configuration in your init file in a way that is
performance-oriented and, well, just tidy.  I created it because I
have over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting
difficult to manage.  Yet with this utility my total load time is
just under 1 second, with no loss of functionality!

See the `use-package' info manual for more information.
