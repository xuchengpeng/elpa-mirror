Installation & configuration
----------------------------
Here are the minimal steps to get EXWM working:
1. Install XELB and EXWM, and make sure they are in `load-path'.
2. In '~/.emacs', add following lines (please modify accordingly):

   (require 'exwm)
   (setq exwm-input-global-keys `(([?\s-r] . exwm-reset)))
   (exwm-enable)

3. Add the following lines to '~/.xinitrc':

   exec emacs

4. Launch EXWM in a console (e.g. tty1) with

   xinit -- vt01

You should additionally hide the menu-bar, tool-bar, etc to increase the
usable space.  Please check the wiki (https://github.com/emacs-exwm/exwm/wiki)
for more detailed instructions on installation, configuration, usage, etc.
