Aircon is a clean and high contrast custom theme for Emacs.  It
consists of a white (#ffffff) background and mostly blues, purples
and greens.  Highlights are subtle but easily visible.  The active
mode-line is white on blue to distinguish it from inactive
mode-lines which are dark blue on light grey.
